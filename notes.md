(Koebel) NPC - three things that matter. most interesting to me, the world, and the PCs
  - naive and childlike / illegala AI / curiously amoral
  - taxi drier / ambitions / desperate crush on bonbon
  - mouth like a sailor, spineless toadie when it comes down to it,  desparate for blood and glory
  - rule of 3.  Stole from Jared Sorensen (game Octane)

what they wear, their car, what makes them scared, things make them attractive,
little BS human things. what do they feel guilty about. Create background ambiance
for the sake of the 3 things the players will care about

----------
Countdown clocks - john harper / Blades as a thing players could interface with
directly.  Track all kinds of time-sensitive stuff in his games. Court of Swords
runs on Countdown Clocks.

example of just how screwed up characters can end up as a result of those critical hit and fumble tables

Dungeon Crawl Classics - fantasy in mold of dnd -super weird. if gary and dave instead of
shoe salesman and lawyer , were hippies, or stoners, and did a lot of mushrooms, and made
a roleplaying game.

Uses d13s and d4s - pysical dice. All the art is so srange and goofy and awkward in a charming
way.
