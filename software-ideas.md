## Scoutliner

Scapple + Outliner


would be cool to have say these scapple bubbles:

and then open up "Castle-Lantern" to get an embedded document:

Essentially an outliner, but with the really breezy UI of Scapple.

Plus text-based document storage, for storing in source code control.

SwiftUI - no collection view equivalent.  CocoaHeads dude has done
an SVG editor thing with a combination of a canvas and swiftui jazz:

Template cards - for stat blocks

Anchor cells, so a "select away from anchor" to pick up subtrees.

- Bubble title vs expanded text. (e.g. enter key in More3)
- second level text (usually shown unless bubble shrunk too much)
- verbose text - only seen in inspector or when hoisting?

View in outline mode
  - gotta give it an anchor to start viewing from
  - could get bizarre outlines, which could be a cool data slice and dice

Click before paste to paste new note there

Markdown text entry - edit ascii, rendered properly

Text ruler / styling for template bubbles

dragon-drop out template bubbles. Double-click and workflow as close to scapple
as possible - keep it fast and fluid.

scapple import

pop-uppable images

Presentation mode - say via mmhmm to show "handouts" / character portraits

panes - say all the NPC bubbles are together in a loose stack, but want to
scoot them all over for more area.  Move a border to scoot them over.  Maybe
like embedded pages or movable anchors

paste and match style

Color chooser that doesn't suck - swatch manager with names. Quick keyboard
shortcut to assign a color.

dashed and solid lines.  Arrows. Line labels.  Easier UI than Scapple's for
arrows and labels.  Long-click on a line perhaps

Run the Jochen generators inside the app.

Free-form text document.

Embedded web view for Campaign Logger?
