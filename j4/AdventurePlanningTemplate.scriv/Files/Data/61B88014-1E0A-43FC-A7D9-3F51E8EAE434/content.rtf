\f0\fs40 \cf0 ### Wrap-up\
\
Without Out of the Box Encounters, I probably would have passed on the opportunity to run this game. Still being fairly new at the GMing thing, I just didn't have time to make something from scratch that would have been satisfying to an 8th-level party. But having all those encounters in one place, to thumb through and found a dozen that would have worked. Then spent a bit more time to winnow them down to four or five encounter. Then an hour reading them closely and figuring out stat blocks.  I have the map pack, so uploaded the maps to their Roll20, added tokens and all that jazz. I was totally ready to run the game. And I still had my weekend.\
