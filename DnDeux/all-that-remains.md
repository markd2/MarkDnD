## TL;DR

* DC 14 history check to learn name of King Torg
* If anyone in the party says "All Hail King Torg", the large
  statue comes to life and converses with them.
* Fog thickens
* DC 10 perception reveals figures swirling in mist in battle
* DC 15 investigation they're the same armies as fighting on the carved
  stone surface.
* Dig in the ground, find a relic (roll on table at end)

## Box Text

On a foggy day, the adventuring party encounters a cliffside
sheared away with precision.  From your vantage point, you can
see what looks like statues?


(If get down there)

In bas relief, characters see a massive set of timeworn carvings.

You see the power and domination of a bygone ruler. An imposing 20
foot tall figure in armor and finery dominates the surface in the very
center of the carvings. Gigantic compared to everything else, this
figure smites several foes with a single blow. Scenes of conquering
armies, falling foes, riches won, exotic beasts being captured and
other signs of conquest — all carved from the same stone face —
surround their mighty ruler.


## More Detailed Notes

Investigating the scenes, DC 14 History check.

Ruler name is King Torg.  If anyone in the party says "All Hail King Torg".
Then the large statue comes to life and speaks.

As exploring, fog thickens.  DC 10 perception reveals figures
swirling through the mists in perpetual melee.  No sound.
Don't react to PCs.  DC 15 investigation same as those armies
fighting on the carved stone surface.  Unending battle.

Detect magic, fog glows.

If characters dig in the ground, find a relic of the battle.

e.g.

```
  1-5  Nothing
 6-10  Bone
11-14  Rusted buckle, button, clasp or similar
15-17  Ruined and broken weapon hilt, spearhead, arrowhead, weapon piece
18-19  Trinket
20     gold coin 
```
