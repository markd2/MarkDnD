## Box Text

The party travels along a lonely road or twisting path through dense
woods, and the foliage abruptly opens into a single enormous, roughly
circular glade.

A thick and tangled copse of trees, vines and brambles grows at the
center of this glade. The central tree is an ancient oak, twisted and
enormous with branches reaching to the sky and bending to the ground
like an umbrella. Woven within these branch- es, innumerable vines
twist and turn like a green tangle of webs, dotted by large white lily
like flowers.

An equally abundant number of thorny brambles shoots from the ground,
entangled among the vines and trees. A very much out of place elephant
stands next to the mass of vegetation feeding on leaves and flowers,
unaware of the charactersâ€™ entrance into the glade. An eagle soars at
treetop level in a circle.

This imposing and tangled growth is not the most surprising feature,
however. A dimly glowing and ever sparkling spiral of light upon the
clearing floor ema- nates from within the growth and spirals outward
to- ward the edge of the glade. Shifting through the colors of the
rainbow, it gives the glade a feylike quality. The air feels charged
with some sort of energy.



## More Detailed Notes

Radius of 150 feet (the entire map)

Conceit is wand of polymorph, lost decades ago by a wizard,
grown into the center of the base of the tree canopy.

The oak "grasps" it

Elephant, eagle, and rat are goblins.

Any creatures approach or start turn within 60 feet of the tree (pretty
much anywhere inside of the open ring).
Once per turn the tree acts.  Each creature must succeed a DC 15 WIS
or be polymorphed into a elephant/eagle/rat.  previous person is
released.  _(instead of everyone, just one is targeted with a higher
DC - say 18)_ Polymorph doesn't affect someone already changed

Transformed creature keeps their mental attributes and personality.
If moved > 150 from the tree, the spell ends.

Goblins act like their animal counterparts.  If released, try to flee
and never return.  Can be questioned, and know about the want.

An eagle can spot the wand with a successful DC20 WIS / Perception
check.  A rat polymorph can navigate the brambles and sniff out
the wand (DC 20 Perception)  Keen Smell gives advantage.

Can navigate the tangles with DC 17 Intelligence (investigation).
Once per turn need to make a DC 20 STR check to pull branches away
to search.  Each check requires DC 15 DEX save to avoid taking 1d8
piercing damage fom the massive thorns.  Elephant gets advantage
and has restance to pierecing damage.

Once wand has been removed > 150 feet away, the randomness stops.
Becomes standard wand.

Polymorphed creatures can be in a world of hurt if they change
form, like a flying eagle.  Or if they're an elephant in the middle,
then turn back to normal.
