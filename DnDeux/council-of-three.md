## TL;DR

- There's a handout of the three heads

- [ ] Come up with something for the wooden head to say.  Wood Golem.
- [ ] Not totally happy with the Stone head.
- [ ] Need something for the mummified head to say. Zombie T-Rex

maybe have the heads interrogate the PCs (get some RP in), and if the
answer incorrectly, they get the bad thing.  Maybe stone head always
gives it the Basislisk egg.

## Box Text

The ancient and ritualistic feel of this chamber strikes the party
as they enter.

DC 10 History check recognize the sinister and centuries old nature of
their surroundings.

Ancient carved reliefs decorate the walls and depict several scenes
of primitive cultures swelling in a jungle environment.

Characters find a long rectangular room inside the chamber.
A raised stepped platform occupies the furthest 10 feet of the room.
Three heads sit atop a stone plinth on the platform.

Chars who examine the carved reliefs on the walls and succeed
a DC 10 Investigation check discover:

- right wall has scenes of ancient figures in worker garments / togas.
Kneeling with their hands raised upward, surrounding a tree.
Rays of light or energy beam down through the leaves. _(tree golem)_

- center wall behind the plinth shows figures, workers in togas, cowering before an
  oversized entity holding a sphere over its head.  There are stylized
  (as compared to the cowering figures) figures, standing like guards
  around it.  _(basislisk egg)_

- The left wall behind the plinth depicts a jungle, with prostrate
  figures in a child's pose, worshipping (?) something off-the-edge.
  _(zombie t-rex)_


On the plinth,
  - left head is a severed, mummified head. Empty eye sockets and mouth
    is wide open.  DC 12 Medicine is a human head, missing the tongue
  - center head is elaborately carved from stone and resembles the carvings
    on each of the walls.  Seems square and has pronounced features.
    1 inch diameter hemispherical indents where the eyes would be, and
    an open mouth carved into it. 1" wide, 3" long groove.
  - The right head is carved from wood and possesses a smoother and more
    rounded quality.  Its features are far smoother and seem carved by
    a different artisan than the stone head. The features are almost
    cherubic.  It too has 1" diameter notches where its eyes would be,
    and a mouth carved to look like it's laughing.  A similar 1" x 3" 
    groove exists in the mouth.

A head activates if  both spheres are placed in the eye sockets of a single
head and the tongue insert.  They lock into place, and the head glows
with a greenish light for a moment, floats upward 5 feet in the air.

- mummified head - Casts augury.  or rises and says "something"
  _(maybe, unleashes a zombie T-Rex)_
- Stone head - "From stone. To Stone" - small panel opens in the back wall
  where the sphre being worshippedi s carved.  Reveals a small cavity where a 
  gray and speckled stoneike egg is hidden.  Jasa gets a vibe.
  It's been in statis for several years.  Now that it's been removed, a
  basilisk begins to hunt the party to get the egg.
- Wooden Head - Rises and begins babbling incoherently.  One person must
  make a DC 15 WIS save. Failure menas charmed and attack a fellow player.

Three clay jars sit in this little storage area, each 8 inches tall
and stoppered with clay plugs, sealed with wax.

  painted on it. Packed in sand that fills the rest ofthe jar
