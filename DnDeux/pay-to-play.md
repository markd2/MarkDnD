## Box Text

(describe a beholder in the shadows, with four eyestalks)

You peer into a dimly lit room.  You see in the shadows, a foot-high
platform.  There's a six-foot
diameter sphere floating above it.  It seems to be rotating slowly. You see four?
things poking out from the top of its head - three-inch diameter spheres
attached to the top of the head.

As it rotates around, you see some detail in the shadows, looks kind of
like a large eye?

## More Detailed Notes

Entering the chamber, light comes on.  Can see there's a sphere with
an oversized jester's cap with four tails, each tail a different color
(red, yellow, blue, green)

In scratched and peeling gold paint above the porthole are the
words in Common "Play Your Fate".  It stops rotating and faces the
closest creature.

DC 10 Investigation or Perception notice a small 1" slot next to the
port hole.  Gold trim tat would normally make it visible is worn
and faded, so couln't spot from a distance.  In Common "1 gold
piece per play"

Speaking to it? Nothing happens.  Totally inactive until a coin (even
a non-gold one).

When a coin goes in, Loud calliope music plays, out to 200 feet.
The four tails of the hat start to slowly spin like helicopter blades.
(1 rotation every 6 seconds)

The portal opens revealing a large metal hand-painted (and scratched)
eyeball.  It darts around looking at each character, then in random
locations. (not really looking at anyone)

The coin-dropper is the target for a light ray (1d4 of the color).  
DC 15 DEX save.  Roll on the wild magic table

Breaking in - AC 19 and 27 hit points. Explodes into shrapnel,
20 foot radius DC 15 DEX save otherwise taking 6d6 piercing damage on
failed save (1/2 on successful)

Contains 50gp, 25sp, 50cp and 1ep
