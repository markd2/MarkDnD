# All That Glitters

Page 14 in _Out of the Box Encounters_. https://nerdarchy.com/product-category/adventures-supplements/out-of-the-box/

## TL;DR

- Room ambience handout

* (Bad CGI Render) _All That Glitters_ an art gallery with a golden horse amongst a pile of bodies
* (Impressionist style) _Menagerie_  A verdant forest scene - with a very large tree poking up out of a round
  clearing.  The technique is incredible, making the tree look like its
  glowing, even though it's just paint
* (Renaissance style) A portrait of a regal gentleman, wearing a crown sitting on a throne.
  A small placard on the elaborate golden frame says "Torg. Reigned 1255-1268"
  If a "all hail king torg" is said, it raises an eyebrow. (maybe a perception
  check)
* (Cubist) _All That Remains_ A scene of a cliff-face, with a stylized army (?) in front of it
* (Hyrenmous Bosch) _Council of Three_ A chapel with an altar with three heads floating over it.
  Scenes of debauchery all around
* (nonrepresnetational charcoal sketch) _P2P_ Kind of round floating sphere (?), with
  four curved lines coming out of the top, lurking in shadows

* Horse about to hoove someone that's down is a great place to cut away

## Box Text

Characters enter a vast and well lit chamber. Lighting comes from
lanterns hovering without chain, rope or stands every 10 feet around
the outside of the room and 15 feet in the air.

The chamber, a 50 foot square, has a 20 foot high vaulted
ceiling. Patterned rugs dyed in rich reds, oranges, and yellows cover
the floors. Six Intricate paintings in different styles adorn the walls.
(two on each wall)

A low 1-foot tall stone plinth stands in the very center of the room,
and upon it a large golden statue of a prancing horse. The statueâ€™s
plinth bears a small brass placard on the base, facing the door.

Placard says "Concorde - Brave steed and trustworthy companion"


## More Detailed Notes

Magic suspends the lamps and provides light

If try to dispel magic on the light, or attempts to force it to fall,
must succeed on DC 12 to break the levitation effect.  Lights don't
extinguish until the golden horse is dead.

Eight Paintings - each painting is large 2 x 3 feet for portraits, and
3 feet by 2 feet for landscapes

Opportunities for lore.

DC 15 History check details on important regional figures / castles /
landmarks

Painters supplies can determine the paintings are valuable works of art
worth 1000gp each.  Weaver's tools the rugs are valuable, woveen
by master craftsmen in foreign lands.  four rugs - 5x10 foot. Each
cumberson, 40 pounds, worth 500gp each.

Looks like a simple art gallery.
Unless someone removes a painting or rug from their place, or tries to
steal the gold plating on the horse, or vandalize the room.

Gold plating worth 5000 gp if removed carefully.  Bonus to proficient
with smiths' tools or tinker's tools for removal.

Any attempt, golden horse activates and attacks the vandals.
Dropping the treasures and running away is their only chance.
Horse purses them for as long as they have treasure / or destroyed

Make a deal of rolling d100 if they look at the painting.
