### Start of Game

* [ ] Burning Wheel joke
* [ ] Thank everyone. "My job is to make Mikey look good".
* [ ] Might want to get on to roll 20
* [ ] Consent - ping Shannon or Alex if you don't want to say anything to the group.
      Even if you're just getting bored by the scenario.  "Wait, this puzzle
      is actually sudoku with dwarven runes. I *hate* sudoku"  No way I'd do that to anyone.
      That'd be mean beyond comprehension.
* [ ] Ready to go?  (go to borkduko)  "so you see before you a grid, with some
      dwarven rules
* [ ] ok, before we actually go on, everyone roll initiative now.  And we'll keep
      that order whenever we need it.  For my players, we'll do traditional 5e style
      rather than our mishmash.
* [ ] fill out the combat tracker

## OotB Encounters for levels 7+


Maybe a couple prepped.  Once they figure out (say the golden horse), then they dream-wipe
to the menagerie.

go to page _printed page # + 2_

### Tier 2
a
- **[All that Glitters](all-that-glitters.md)** (pg 14) : golden horse chases anyone who has grabbed treasure
      until they drop it
- Deep Breaths (pg 53) : Lizard Folk ruler / swamp 
- Enemy at the Gate (pg 68) : Shape-changing Oni with a polearm, taking over a character
      (maybe conspire with someone?) - Guard, get a character, go do something else, then
      they start having fun.
- Girl with the Dragon SNAFU (pg 95) - Bard and Succubus
* **[Menagerie](menagerie.md)** (pg 118) - giant tree (wand of polymorph), goblins as elephant/eagle/rat, each
  turn the tee acts, DC 15 wisdom save or be polymorphed randomly into one of these
  creatures.  _(Badger, Snake, Mushroom?)_ - looks like fun
- Phoba's Bet (pg 136) - (12 difficulty for 1:1, lower for bigger party) Kind of intended
  to be an ongoing villain.  (medusa bounty hunter)
- Procession (pg 138) - funeral barge.  Opportunity for lore dump.  Tough battle with
  undeades

### Any

* **[All that Remains](all-that-remains.md)** (pg 17) - cliffside bas-relief.  Lore dump potential.  Misty figures.
  can dig for trinkets 
* Coin Flip (pg 37) - enter room, floor vanishes, replaced with grid of coins. Coin flip,
  roll on appropriate table. Staying on coin doesn't re-do effect. Only one character.
  Cool idea, but not happy with the tables (beneifts are to much, misfortune is things
    like damage / exhastion
* **[Council of Three](council-of-three.md)** (pg 43) - three heads - assemble one of the heads and get something,
  like augery, a basislisk out to get them, or charms a PC into attacking on its turns.
  Kind of cool, but want to tweak the third one
- Dinner Party (pg 60) - Table at Inn, food tainted with Truth Serum. Roll 1d20 and a pair
  of d20s (save against poison, or advantage against poison), also a random madness
  table. 
- Fibble's Fantastic Familiars (pg 77) - Pet Shop.  Depends on being able to cause
havoc in a community
- Mirrors of the Soul (pg 124) - Requires 1:1 ability. Needs character flaws
* **[Pay to Play](pay-to-play.md)** (pg 133) - sphere with a jester's hat.  Four colors, put in coin and get
  zapped.  The given table is +/-1 of ability score, or +/-1 saving throw.  Maybe
  something more interesting like wand of wonder, or that wand of polymorph (or maybe
  wild magic table). Describe it like a beholder.
- Shadow of Your Former Self (pg 146) - requires prep, to create shadow versions of
  the characters and fight them.  - Maybe conspire with someone or two or twelve ahead
  of time.  They've done something similar before.

## Character bios

**Aralin** (Liv) the Aasimar Warlock, has already manifested her wings a
  couple times but doesn’t do it frequently. Prefers to get up close and
  personal with her pact greatsword or glaive.  Snarky and flippant.

**Bre** (Downie) serious and brooding. Very athletic/acrobatic melee monk. Has trust issues.

**Feratu** (ABailey) half-Drow druid, is like that emo kid from school. Party rescued
  him in a dungeon a long time ago.Can turn into a bat more
  easily than other animals, and can fly limited distances as one.
  has been on the hunt for vampires, because he hates how much society
  seems to think he is one. F.ex, he has a mild silver and sunlight
  allergies, and doesn’t have a reflection, but that’s leftover from a
  witch’s curse.

**Gname** (Pfrog) gnomish rogue/scout, Seems like a nervous sort so far.

**JASA** (Madison) is a human barbarian and longish time friend of Bre (the
  halfling monk). Jasa has a ring with a bear magically stored in it
  which she can summon, but she might have forgotten about it. She
  doesn’t like magic, is a bit freaked out by it. But, has an almost
  druidic relationship with the Earth Mother, a guardian spirit of the
  forest.

**Nonnahs** (Tamida) is the empath of the group. Largely pacificst, but that
  view is changing in light of the frequency in which the world tries
  to kill her and her friends.
  She’s a wild-magic sorceress, so don’t hesitate to lean on tides of
  chaos and wild magic surge. Nonnahs has a bit of a complex about her
  wild magic, because it’s done serious damage to her family in the
  past, and she’s been on a spirit quest to learn how to control it.
