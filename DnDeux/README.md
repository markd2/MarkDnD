----------

## OotB Encounters for levels 7+

Maybe a couple prepped.  Once they figure out (say the golden horse), then they dream-wipe
to the menagerie.

go to page _printed page # + 2_

### Tier 2

- **All that Glitters** (pg 14) : golden horse chases anyone who has grabbed treasure
      until they drop it
- Deep Breaths (pg 53) : Lizard Folk ruler / swamp 
- Enemy at the Gate (pg 68) : Shape-changing Oni with a polearm, taking over a character
      (maybe conspire with someone?) - Guard, get a character, go do something else, then
      they start having fun.
- Girl with the Dragon SNAFU (pg 95) - Bard and Succubus
* **Menagerie** (pg 118) - giant tree (wand of polymorph), goblins as elephant/eagle/rat, each
  turn the tee acts, DC 15 wisdom save or be polymorphed randomly into one of these
  creatures.  _(Badger, Snake, Mushroom?)_ - looks like fun
- Phoba's Bet (pg 136) - (12 difficulty for 1:1, lower for bigger party) Kind of intended
  to be an ongoing villain.  (medusa bounty hunter)
- Procession (pg 138) - funeral barge.  Opportunity for lore dump.  Tough battle with
  undeades

### Any

* **All that Remains** (pg 17) - cliffside bas-relief.  Lore dump potential.  Misty figures.
  can dig for trinkets 
* Coin Flip (pg 37) - enter room, floor vanishes, replaced with grid of coins. Coin flip,
  roll on appropriate table. Staying on coin doesn't re-do effect. Only one character.
  Cool idea, but not happy with the tables (beneifts are to much, misfortune is things
    like damage / exhastion
* **Council of Three** (pg 43) - three heads - assemble one of the heads and get something,
  like augery, a basislisk out to get them, or charms a PC into attacking on its turns.
  Kind of cool, but want to tweak the third one
- Dinner Party (pg 60) - Table at Inn, food tainted with Truth Serum. Roll 1d20 and a pair
  of d20s (save against poison, or advantage against poison), also a random madness
  table. 
- Fibble's Fantastic Familiars (pg 77) - Pet Shop.  Depends on being able to cause
havoc in a community
- Mirrors of the Soul (pg 124) - Requires 1:1 ability. Needs character flaws
* **Pay to Play** (pg 133) - sphere with a jester's hat.  Four colors, put in coin and get
  zapped.  The given table is +/-1 of ability score, or +/-1 saving throw.  Maybe
  something more interesting like wand of wonder, or that wand of polymorph (or maybe
  wild magic table). Describe it like a beholder.
- Shadow of Your Former Self (pg 146) - requires prep, to create shadow versions of
  the characters and fight them.  - Maybe conspire with someone or two or twelve ahead
  of time.  They've done something similar before.
