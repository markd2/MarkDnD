Recap:
  - "Catch it"
  - Jimmy runs, chased by agents, hear a loud pop
  - follow the trail, branches pushed away in a 360 degree circle.  The agent
    footprints around, but Jimmy's are gone. Maybe Jimmy was a bomb
  - Maybe Jimmy is a scary serial killer
  - went to Jimmy's house. Deserted.  Found some clothes and porn, Jimmy's
    room rifled.  Found an inhaler and some empty cartriges
    "Hey jimmy, I was just here to bring over a casserole because your dad died"
    - Mr King has a Phd in physics from CMU.  "He knows the inventor of physics"
      maybe he's an alien, like mork and mindy!

  - called the FBI via the yellow pages
    - "please call again during normal business hours"
    - "This is Mrs King to see if Jimmy is coming back soon"
    - gave the callback number for Mr Mahoud's number (303 222 2222)

  - Go to the Q, get some dog food and some treats (and a box of pop tarts)

  - Saturday night, evening falls, Grace goes home, and is quickly broken out
  - Objective - break in to the EnCom Scientific using some stolen badges from
    michael's father.  (trying to find Jimmy, or Stuff on Jummy, since
    it's the weirdest place in town)
  - go in to the entrance, push a button under the desk to open a side door,
    go down in an elevator.  Parking deck.  yawn.  Basement.  Large, open, full
    of junk.  find a push-bar door with stairs going up.  Find a door frame?  the
    door is solidly there, no handle, no knob, no hinges, no gap.
  - Sparky disappears with a resolute POP , feeling a brief rush of air where
    sparky was

Current scene:
  - in the basement of the EnCom Scientific Instruments building
