# Session 1 notes

Carson Creek

Emily:
  - GRACE ELLIS
  - going with a stock build
  - between Plastic Beauty or Conspiracy Theorists
  - Plastic Beatuy
  - Cool under pressure, Intuitive, rebellious, demanding, vindictive
  - charm: d20
  - Introduction: 
My dad is the pastor at the local church, so well behaved. (PK!), love
my long straight hair, perfectly thick for this age, and perfect
french braid.  Am the oldest of three
Denim jacket with shoulder pads, high waist jeans rolled at the cuff, and
a bright-pink shirt.
1 1/2 cans of aqua net.
  - Backpack
    - lighter hairspray eyeshadow (shoplifted)
    - diary, cosmo magazine, clothes she changed out of going to schol

  - Motivation - being in control, like once out of the house changes
    to cool clothes (no control at home). This is my situation to control,
    and if I can't that's when I lash out.
  - Fear - scared of the dark, being uncool, and being caught by her parents

  - Questions
  - GRACE would respect MICHAEL (I get it, I get the pettiness), will roll
    on positive table for that.  (7)
  - what plan do you have with this character that most excites you.
    - not supposed to get teachers in trouble. This one teacher was harping
      on my outfit all day, MICHAEL saw this, such a bitch, and has to
      learn a lesson, what if, we got some shaving cream and MICHAEL went
      not good enough, what if we actually put the shaving cream under the jacket 
      she puts on her chair, it squirts out in front of everyone in class
    - definitely doing that next time in case.  (he put cheese on her car,
      paint, potato in the tailpipe)
  - About ALLISON (4)
    - what charming habit is this character known for around town.
      I heard a rumor, and i don't know who came up with ti, that ALLISON spends
      her weekends picking up trash in the park. There are people who do that,
      and they do that all the time. You should be more like her.  Nah, Im in
      church, gotta be in church and not picking up trash. (hates that she
      ditches church to go pick trash
  - About ALAN, negative
    - makes you immediately lose your temper?  every time that there's something
    happening, pep rally, in the middle cracking a joke. We're supposed to loo
    at the pep rally, "look at me I'm funny in my raggedy-ass clothes, like
    clown." like a court jester but not in a good way
  - Motivation
  - Backpack (with shoplifted) notes
    - lighter and spray

Mikey:
  - ALAN KELMP
  - Looking at Funny Sidekick, to relive my childhood.
  - Funny Sidekick
  - easy going loyal, absent minded, clumsy, rebellious
  - introduction
Spends a lot of time outside the house, parents are techs at the local
hospital, they put in overtime and shifts / overworked. not a reliable
dinner time, and not a reliable schedule at home. Just tags around with
whomever doing something. Never leading the group, and hanging out
with what ever's going down.

unkelmpt appearance, hoodie, clothes are hand me downs, and brother has a different
build (jock), it's all a little awkward)
  - Motivation - ALAN major motivation is to gotten to know so many people,
    fully aware, tolerate.  Friend or friend group that actually enjoyed to
    have him around.
  - fear of alone and forgotten, being actively disliked. Tolerated is fine,
    but hated is one of the reason to tell so many jokes, pull that line
    at least towards tolerance.

  Questions
   - Negative Table on MICHAEL (17)
     - why do you dislike this character while the others love them
     - I'm used to being used to blending in whatever group is up to
       something, most of the cliques. Never allowed to take point on
       anything, tagging along on whatever they're doing, fade in
       background and tell a joke every once and while
       MICHAEL doesn't. Whenever I'm with his group, he seems to not want
       me there more than the others, and points that out, not directly,
       via like "dafuq doing here"
   - positive (3) GRACE
     - what great kindness did this character do that they don't even remember
     - It was a couple of grade ago, and I was supposed to, folks coming to
       get me, but didn't have a way to let me know something was going down
       at the hospital.  So I'm just hanging out at the school, the sun sets,
       I think GRACE hung out, and for her it was maybe had a spat with friends
       and work off steam that wouldn't make you as angry as they had, or if if
       just amusement. Don't think GRACE realized how much meant to have
       company. And again, just for the umpteen-million'th time not coming 
       get me.  I get they're involved in their jobs. GRACE kept me from being
       lonely that night.  But that sticks with me
   - positive (11) ALLISON
     - what lengths would you go to to defend this character?
     - from what? (from GRACE or MICHAEL to be honest) - who are the biggest
       preditors in the room.  I could see ALAN  being a why can't we get
       along kind of person.  Like a verbal threat - a lot, fades into
       background and doesn't have a lot to lose. From a physical
       threat, would have a
       low grit / low fight / high flight / high brawn and charm.  The
       lengths against a physical threat is grabbing and getting out of there,
       not standing in the way.
Backpack:
   - snacks, poptarps potato skin, surge,
   - playing card and guidebook to magic picks
   - hardy boys infinity clue
   - small rock perfect for skipping
   - tiny swiss army know - classic
   - spare shoe lace, to stitch up the pocket of the backpack.


Shannon:
  - ALLISON REYNOLDS
  - Loner Weirdo
  - Grit: d20
  - flaws: blunt, disobedient
  - strength: cool under pressure, prepared, rebellious
  - introduction
Has shoulder-length dark brown hair, not dyed. It is a little unruly
but not out of control. Wearing a long back overcoat over a button-ups
men shirt, also black, hanging on top of, men's trousers. All appears to
be intentionally second hand.  Wearing combat boots that everybody knows
the only place to get them is that one military surplus store.  HAlf
a size too big.  Big satchel cross-body, everyone introducing themselves and
she's staring at the ground.  She looks up, rolls eyes, and grunts. Allison.
At this point ,ALAN trying to make a joke, or a MICHAEL talks about his
parents, or GRACE wants to braid hair - f'ing not, and pretend like no one
is talking.
  - Motivation - some of the reason ALISON is so concerned, is her mother
    left five years ago, went out for that pack of cigarettes and never came
    back.  Part is always waiting for her mother to come back, and outward
    saying She's never coming back.  She was a loner weirdo before her mother
    left.  People may not even know.  If someone in our crew parents worked
    in the front-office, but MICHAEL and GRACE don't know that her mom is
    gone, and they wouldn't care. Nobody knows. Motivation is a desire
    to hide the information, and put forward a tough exterior.
  - Fear being alone and left behind
  - When she smokes, its clove (but she doesn't smoke)

  Questions
   - don't know for GRACE. I kept a solid distance, and not disclosed,
     know MICHAEL, don't know GRACE.
   - why are so many townspeople afraid of this character? (GRACE)
     - they know her parents, and they know they can't say shit to her, so
      she's become a terror.  She shows up with the braids, perfect hairand
      perfect smile and clothes, and everyone is ewww here she is, and they
      smile through the experience, because of the experience.  nobody
      wants to be in bad with that family, feel like GRACE learned everything
      she knows from her mother (absolutely - the perfect Pastors wife and
      let NO ONE question it), and you have never seen anyone as mean as the
      pastor's wife.  and GRACE knows all this, and she leans in to it.
   (definitely picks up trash at the part)
   - negative ALAN (18) - you hurt this character years ago, why can't you
     apologize.  Because I have a giant crush on ALAN. And just going to
     let the awkward simmer.  We're all 13.  Lemme just tell you what happened.
     In a moment / an attempt to be cool, probably in front of MICHAEL's
     friend group, I cracked a joke about ALAN's clothes, and have not let
     it go for myself, and at the time I know exactly what he was wearing,
     had been starting at him all day trying to talk to him all day. Then
     one of MICHAEL friend goons made a joke about me, and the first thing
     was ALAN, because he was on my mind. He was so sad. Crush has not faded.
     I'm a weird, don't have any friends. I avoid because I can. The last
     interaction was making fun of him to one of his gooney friends.
   - negative MICHAEL (4) - what are you sure this character is hiding from you?
     - Allison's parents, it's the f'in 80s, so Allison's dad is peers with
       MICHAEL's dad. I'm sure that this character knows that my dad's
       about to get fired - something is going on at work, MICHAEL has his
       shit together, and so his dad, and my dad doesn't know that I exist,
       he's just working all the time.  There's an instability thing.
       I think, convinced that MICHAEL's dad, that his dad knows something
       my dad doesn't know, and some kind of instability knowledge.
  Backpack - 
   - zippo and lighter fluid,
   - can of spraypaint
   - canteen from army surplus store, full of fresh water
   - beef jerky from her Uncle
   - $10 bill
   - roll of quarters
   - the rest of the bag is literally full of trash scraps. Can be specific
     or unspecific.  Sundays are busy, and it is slightly organized (to ALLISON),
     disorganized to the casual observer - has the important piece of trash

Zack:
  - MICHAEL CARTWRIGHT (Mikey gets corrected)
  - this is literally my childhood, but 8 years later.
  - Hitting things with sticks seems important - rocks / bottles.
    It's going to be a thing.  The stick goes on the back on the
    bike. The stick goes with you.
  - The Circle Q all the time, I hung out at an exxon station
  - between bully and conspiracy theory
    - having a hard time choosing
  - be one of the rich kids
  - Bully
  - Wealthy, Lucky, Petty, ignorant, Rebellious
  - Fight: d20
  - Grit: d8
  - Introduction
A little misunderstood, I have to spend a lot of my time in school
correcting people, just because i'm a rich kid, doesn't mean I can
be cool, and be nice to people. I could be nice if I wanted to. I could.
And I think everyone is mad that my parents bascially employ them.
Not my problem.
A madonna tank
  - Motivation - is to be seen, his house is huge and it's so empty,
    nobody is there. Don't know what's up with Dad or Mom at work. usually
    she's traveling, we don't know if it's actually for work. I love being
    seen, and the attention from GRACE when we bully the teacher and people,
    so we have interaction
  - Fear is being alone

  - PARENTS - MUCKETY MUCKS at EnCom Scientific Instruments
  - character you know negative (to GRACE)
  - What would GRACE character do to forgive them?
    - we're kindred spirit - wronging each other is our love language.
      IT's our relationship
    - don't know why people don't get on board with us. They do't get us.
      They're jealous.
  - ALAN, Positive Table
    - What do you admire about this character but never tell them.
      - the outfits. There's something familiar about ALAN's outfits,
        I've seen them before. There's something familiar about them
        that I enjoy.  Sometimes he tries to make jokes, and like that
        he's trying.
  - ALLISON - positive, for the bully need an offset (17)
    - what aspect of this character's personality do you use a model for your
      own.  I respect how DGAF ALLISON has.  I really appreciate it, she seems
      cool because she like effortless does not care about people, and something
      I try to embody - is not caring about people.
  - Backpack 
    - walk man (purchased) cassettes I may have had
    - true blue (")
    - notebook, diet coke, paid for (didn't steal
    - half pack of kool, no lighter

Brunch Club

----------

* What's your personal connection to the Circle Q - what do you do there,
  how's your relation ship with Mahmoud.

(and then others)

and then, how did you end up in the Brunch Club.

Mahmoud Shirari - owner of the Circle Q
Rachel Kelly - town police chief

* What's your personal connection to the Circle Q - what do you do there,
  how's your relation ship with Mahmoud.

ALLISON - Goes to the exxon, part of the pickup zone. Very strong, as a result
   of the trash picking up, get complementary cocoa-colas, occasionally.
   Not why I pick up trash. He likes me, and occasionally on a sunday forces
   a soda on em. I know it's a safe place, so I don't go there often, but
   the place to get sodas for free, and a place get zippo fluid without
   getting shit from anybody. Maybe why I'm there.
   Sometimes take quarters out of my fight quarters, when no one is around.
   Don't want them to know.  Obsessed with GALEN'S QUEST
   "AAA" on the leaderboard, nobody knows who it is.
GRACE - the circle q is where i change my clothes, get out of the dowdy clothes
   my parents let me wear and in to the cool clothes, and where i change out,
   so they don't catch me. b/c, also actually uncharacteristically nice and
   respectable, don't want to ruin the ability to change clothes there.
MICHAEL - i like going to circle q to hang out with GRACE, but she's always
   weird, b/c she's nice to the guy. i don't even know his name. i like their
   chicken tenders. i see people there everyone once and a while. and the weird
   girl is hanging out in the trash.  i wanna go play the game, but so nerd.
   so watching from a far.
ALAN - Mahmood likes a lot for not causing trouble, and paying in exact change.
  that's because i tend not to carry bills big enough to break.
  spend time when there's not many people to hang out with -responsible for
  my own dinner, so have a lot of "dinners" there. make sure i have enough
  money to eat and feed myself, unlikely either will be home to fix dinner
  on any given day.  a lot of snack-based, microwaveable dinners.
  (bond over chicken fingers with MICHAEL)
  - not what i want to spend my limited funds on. i watch them on a lot.
    the score ladder on the cabinets.  spend time trying to hype people up.
 
Who here has the highest score in galaxanoid?
  - ALLISON - AAA

Who got into an argument with Mr. Killian (history teacher) and got suspended for three days?
  - GRACE, but didn't tell her parents she got suspended. A three  day
    period but parents don't know about it. Ad MICHAEL thought it was so
    cool. 
  - about? She basically forced one of the smarter kids to write her
    paper, and got caught.

Chief Kelly
  - ALLISON, to tell my dad that he's proud of the work I've been doing,
    voluntarily picking up trash. and b/c it was her, dad pretended to
    care. She was trying to do me a solid, and quicky realized he didn't
    care.

Favorite teacher, and teach
  - MICHAEL - Dr. Boox, English Teacher, knows I'm an idiot but we have great
    conversation. Smartest person in the world.  Love the validation
  - ALLISON - Librarian, Francis Wright (she/her). souped up the Mac, and they
    let me tinker and learn.  computery things
  - GRACE - Mrs. Williams, the home-ec teacher. She helped show me how to sew
    my own clothes, to modify stuff I picked up, or installing my own shoulder
    pads
  - ALAN - Mr. Cox the science teacher - often made of by students b/c of his
    name and b/c he's incredibly stereotypically nerdy - nasal, cokebottle
    glasses. b/c class is empty during lunch, chatting about fantasy or
    sci books.  And brought in a tape of the pilot episode of MacGyver

Do you want to leave Carson Creek when you grow up?
  - ALLISON - every day
  - MICHAEL - I'll leave - what's everyone else doing
  - ALAN - I want to go off on adventures with people, someone to let me know
    they're leaving town, this is the jailbreak, but I'm not going to do that
    myself
  - GRACE - absolutely - wants to leave.  The cosmo magazine- wants to be
    a fashion editor.  Not what her pastor parents want for her.

Worst Thing You'e Done for arcade money?
  - ALAN - go without
  - MICHAEL - stole from GRACE, looked in her bag
  - GRACE - super duper nice to Mahmood, hey I forgot my coins, can I borrow
    a couple.  d20 on charm baby.
  - ALLISON doesn't want for cash, but you don't know that. everyone assumes
    she's not rich.  Her dad feels guilty, and dad gives her money. Sometimes
    feeds ALAN.

----------

Breakfast Club - why are you there.

You need a time-out to contemplate yourself.

trash - someone spraypainted, and we're community servicing cleaning up
the walls.

ALLISON: her jam
GRACE: Parents forcing me to be here for some kind.
MICHAEL:  did some mean girls thing to somebody.
   threw my drink at someone, frozen Smurfee..  The history teacher (killian)
   giving the english teacher a hard time, and I couldn't control it.
ALAN: After lunch when Mr Cox brought in the cassette with some of the MacGuyver
   on it, he skipped the next couple of periods to keep watching episodess,
   didn't even realize that classes were going on. Full on ADHD moment, school
   is ending, by then faculty knew that he peaced out.
LOOMIS: Foster kid, everyone expected trouble. 
   Mister Killian marked question wrong on a quiz, and I got it right, and
   i very took that didn't win the argument in class, I let the air out of
   his tires.  But someone saw me and tattled.
