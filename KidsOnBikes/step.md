Character concept.

Interconnections will happen during session

ChatJippity - stronger character, inspired by Evan from Misfits and Magic,
obvious but have depth

Cassian - Circus Performer, originally who heaerd whispering from
shells, now geodes - all kind of everywhere.  Superstitious
connections to geodes, and hold different powers, and also a fan of
colorful linins, and something going on with the circus and family,
but kind of chasing destiny a little bit, chasing fate, the secrets in
the rocks that speak to them, and probalby comes off as goofy.

almost like an astrologist. Connected to the earth

circus in town?  Figure that out together, possible, thinking the circus left
town a while, and he has stayed here.  teen/child/adult? KoB implies teenage,
at most he'd be a young adult.  Thinking teen or young?

Where's he staying?  anyone in the group would pipe in.  They suggest something,
calls him an exchange student.  Not trying to pin down too much more.

The truth of who they are needs to evolve along with those answer.

NEAT!

maybe a fortune teller, thought were making stuff up, and pretended to not believe,
but kind of belived, now the rock thing has pulled in.

(Plus geodes popular in late 70s and 80s)

mikey: young childhood 80s
shannon: younger still
emily:
zach: younger

made a thing (bot) for building out backstories - gave it two sentences, and
have it flesh it out. Gave a 7 or 8 concepts and wanted to do 5 or 6 of them.
Picking this one, and asking more questions, it's terrible at names.
