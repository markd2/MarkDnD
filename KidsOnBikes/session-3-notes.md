    - "clone"

  * mr kilian and his grade book
    - perhaps on the next monday
    - jimmy not at school
    - "i noticed a couple of attempts to adjust some grades.  kind
      of puzzling that the recipient of the better grades doesn't
      have the skill to pull this off.  if you want to come clean
      before i start the academic misconduct wheels in motion,
      stop by my office"

  * maybe a note gets to someone 
    - "help.  you're the only one i can trust.  jk"
    - smells vaguely of lemon
      - maybe hiding out in one of the closed legs of the royal bridge mall
    - to michael
      - Wild Man: "Why these two (Michael / Grace). They are not good people
        like Allison and Alan.  This Loomis. I do not know you"
      - Jimmy: "Because he's mean. And rich. and popular"

----------

intro(e)

camera zooming in on the circle q.  bottom-right corner says "saturday 5:00am".

inside, a darker skinned gentleman is doing morning tidying, stocking
the shelves.  we can hear the inner monolog davidlynchdune style.
"make sure the shelves are beautiful.  it's one of the few signs of
devotion i have."  moves to the smurfee machine, drains it, wipes out the 
chamber and towels it dry.  pours in buckets of ice, some water, and
the flavor packets. one a deep blue, another deep red. "that much food
coloring can't be good for the children.  today is an in-school
suspension day. i think they'll be needing their smurfees"

he services the ladies rest room. "grace needs a clean place to change"

he opens a small bar fridge, pulls out two chicken tendies from yesterday.
"i bet sparky could use a snack".  walks outside, behind the building
in the back parking lot. "sparky!  treats!".  there's a bow-bow as the
town mutt bounds out, tail wagging a mile a minute.  mahmoud shariari 
feeds one tendie to sparky, then throws the other one in to the woods, sparky
chasing after it.  it's a regular game they play.

camera pulls out to the front again. bottom-right corner, says "saturday 9:00am".
not much traffic, just the occasional kid wanting a smurfee or someone
filling up their tank.  you can hear voices, quietish from behind the
building.

"i told you i don't have access any more. i can't get it." <pause> "i don't
care what that little bastard thinks. i. can't. get. it." <pause> "what
are you doing.  oh no.  oh no.  oh"  and you hear a slumping noise, then 
footsteps, followed by the crunch of leaves"

you see a group of teenagers at their school. "saturday 9:00am"
the preacher's kid.  the bully.  the loner.  the clown.
the runaway.  they're being given implements of cleaning by their history
teacher, grover kilian.  he's tall, crew cut, pretty swole.  they proceed
to clean dicks off the walls.

you see a group of younger kids.  one taller, kind of shaggy.  oftentimes
wearing a black eye or bruises. jimmy king. he's on gum-scraping duty.

back to the circle q, "saturday 9:30am"  mahmoud gathers the morning detritus
into a trash bag, heads out the back door towards the dumpster.  sees a dead
body on the pavement.  glances over at it emotionlessly.  sighs.  "dammit.
things are going to get complicated. again"  moseys to the dumpster, tosses
the trash in non-chalantly.  returns inside, calls the police to report
a dead body.

back at the school "saturday: 9:45am", most of the dicks are gone.
time for a snack. the older kids head over the circle q.

police chief kelly shows up "saturday: 9:45am" along with a deputy car, 
starts cordening off the scene.  tretches police tape across the entire circle q parking lot, essentially shutting it down. 

"saturday: 10:00am.  the kids show up.  the loner talks to chief kelly. chief
tries to summon mahmoud by bullhorn.  there's some tension on both their parts.
he comes out and chats"

the preacher's kid sneaks into the circle q, guarded by the bully,
emerging with smurfees, smokes, and gum.

the runaway sneaks around back, gets a good look at the body before a deputy pulls
a tarp over it.  mister king.  jimmy's dad.  weird injury on the forehead. not as much blood on the ground as one would hope.  good riddance

the pk, bully, and runaway head back to the school

the clown stands apart, very still, as if waiting for instructions, or at least
for whatever situation is happening passes.

a vehcile shows up.  dr chelsey myers steps out, walks to the body.  pokes at it,
writes on a clipboard handed to her by the deputy,  signs something, hands it.
heads to her car and takes off.

at the school, they notice mr. killian's car idling out front. they
easily break in to a side door, near the bathrooms and mr. killian's office.
they see mr. killian escorting jimmy out the building

mr. killian's office is open.  they go in.  pk and the bully change grades and
erase a good comment about stephanie with whiteout.  the runaway digs through the
file cabinet, rapidly passing over past and future tests, until he gets to the
bottom drawer.  pulls out a drawer.  sees a black belt certificate from a karate
dojo in washington dc.  sees a defense department dd-256 form, colonel grover kilian ,honorably discharged from the air force, about 15 years ago. "this is great!"  and the runaway closes the drawer.

before the drawer closes, you see some papers moving about.  a defense departmnt form
dd-318, "reinstatement of duty.  there is a red stamp, "extreme sanction authorized".
also a blank white plastic card on a lanyard.

back at the q.  mr. killian's car pulls in.  jimmy is taken out back.  a horrible
sound emerges.  mahmoud stalks in to the q, with the loner on his heels.

they both come back.  mr killin haeads to his car. jimmy looks shaken.  he starts
heading towards the clown for a hug.

another car pulls up.  tinted windows.  doors open, two dudes in suits and sunglasses
get out.  one heads towards the circle , one turns around and evaluates the scene.



----------

wild man - long hair, down past his shoulders, normal harline, really nice.
full beard. long, but well kept trimmed. from a distance, he seems really intense.
  "hippie" - up close, obviously clean..  he's hot. 
  - brown eyes, sharper features.  square jawline.  he's hot.

----------

grace - keep seeing charles manson. somethine else.

like a hot charles manson.  "that's like saying atm machine"

----------

genocide-qua

----------

we did our grade book shenanigans.  not spend too much time.  find the answer
key for the next test.  grace: let's not risk it.

----------

what did you do.  there was
ALAN - there was a moment alone with the fing body of his dad, that's when
    up close and draping an arm over his shoulder. when adults started
   showing up again.  non-confrontataional.
    feet away.

runs, they charge.
 is there an opportunity to interfeere

difficulty dc 10, brawn, fight.  stumble in their path, wait, what are you doing.

7 + 1.


son, who are you.  "jimmy, that's it's name".  why do you call him.
dr. king.

around here.  what's your name, where do you live?  

around here, and i back away.

"you. stay here. and takes off running"

go back, other side of the parking lot, normal police.

alan goes inside the circle q.  feels safe.

two guy in black suits, chasing him into the forest and called him an it.

jimmy.  really weird cops.  secret service.

"any kind of badge"

and a loud pop.

grace - sign out, the time we're supposed to leave, clearly the time we're supposed
to leease.  "he left us unsupervised".
  - signed them out
  - dc 5 brains to forge their signatures
    - spending 2 at, for a roll of 3 to be a 5.
  - down to 1 at

allison's signature
  - a loner eweirdo, her writing is a series of loops, (like a rollercoaster), the
    i has a heart over it.  big loops
alan's signature
  - bunch of up and down.
  - his dad's signature looks pretty different.  has forged it, but don't remember
    dad's name, 

(false hydra - embeds in commuities with lies that are being told, lives off
lies, memory loss, forget people around them, and implants hallucinations.
it's fun)

if not obviously.  mister mahmoud.  hey.  you're done for the day. we're
all done for the day. why did the.

"that's for the courts to decide"

beverly hilbillies.  "i could get him into the circus maybe"

allison wandered off to video games muttering htings about

grace: could jimny could live with the circus instead of with hillbillies.

alan raises his hand.  "this isn't class, you can jsut say it"
  - point that jummy didn't run off, chased two men in black suits, said
    catch it."

ograce - i bet jimmy killed his dad.  why would the fbi be chasing hes a searial killer

loommis - he didn't crate the situation.  he'd be a scary serial killer, he could
 kill a dad, or a teacher, so the fbi has to put a stop to it.

michael - that would explain the fbi.

allison - non of this make any sense.

always bruises, and clumsy, 'we have motive'

grace - i have an idea - what if we get the yellow pages, and call the fbi,
  look 'em up. everyone's in the yellow pages.

loomis - you can't trust adults like that.  we should go find jimmy, scared
and run off in the woods

grace - what if he kills us/

----------

dropping off grace
  - takes a while (prayers) before popping out the window.  mommy's watching.
  - probably 10pm by the time she's done.

we've eaten and rested.  now ready to go.

m: retcon a flashlight.

g: shape pillows and clothes to look like sleeping. i can't lock the door, but block
   it.

go to michal's place.  need to get something so we can get in.
looking in parent's room, looking for drawers, something that could get me.

how careful rifling through parent's stuff.  just ripping through it.
  - m's dad's name = jeffrey cartwright
  - "he runs the place"
al: knows he's the same level. neither of them run the place.

grab two badges, look at alison, and alison grabs one violently from his
hands, and immediately walks out the front door.

shall we?  lets?  let's go to encom

----------
it looks like 

cmaeras - no lights glowing

al: swipe the card, light turns green, clunk
  disappears immediately into the building.

grace actually nervous about this, keeping that exit open if she neds to bolt.
  - she's with the group, doing that thing, very back of the group, trying not
    being in the main pack, if she needs to bolt- the scardy cat.
