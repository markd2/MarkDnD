Needed Scenes
  * Maybe a Jimmy rescue?

    - Leave my dad alone!
    - "clone"

  * Mr Kilian and his grade book
    - perhaps on the next monday
    - Jimmy not at school
    - "I noticed a couple of attempts to adjust some grades.  Kind
      of puzzling that the recipient of the better grades doesn't
      have the skill to pull this off.  if you want to come clean
      before I start the academic misconduct wheels in motion,
      stop by my office"

  * maybe a note gets to someone
    - "help.  you're the only one I can trust.  JK"
    - smells vaguely of lemon
      - maybe hiding out in one of the closed legs of the Royal Bridge Mall
