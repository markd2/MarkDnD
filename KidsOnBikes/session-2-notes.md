Step:

- LOOMIS HELLGROVE
- Conspiracy theorist
  - Lucky
  - Treasure Hunter
  - Rebellious
  - Flippant
  - Petty

Introduce yourself.

Joseph and techincalolor coat.  He rolled up into town with the circus, and
sort of settled here.  Things did't go well with the circus. When it left
town, Loomis stayed. (not sure how paying for stufF)

Mop of curly brown hair, skragly, skinny. Colorful outfit. Patchwork colorful
jacket.  patches on jeans.  Large Messenger bag that has 16 different colors
that it's made of. Not super incorporated into the town, necessarily
Not the first one to speak up.

GRACE
  - positive 17 - do you try to use as a model for your own?
    love how GRACE adapts to her situation, model how my detachment is an
    affectation model what I see of you.
  - GRACE->LOOMIS - past, still resent them for?
    because a circus kid, and that's the kind of thing that everyone is
    obsessed over. Not even your fault, but when first showed up and introduced,
    paying more attention to you.  OMG what's it like circuis / traveling,
    resenting, not the center of attention and in control of the narrative
    "Showing up is what she resents"
ALLISON
  - positive 17 - kindest thing this character has ever doen for you
    - First week of school, verge of major social faux pas, the attention
      of the bullies, Allison pulled me aside, and gave me a quick tip,
      and being thankful, she brushed me off.  Avoided a near catytlcismic
      disaster.
      Lunch room, walking to sit with them. Hey, Cool Guy, come sit over here.
      the next day "sit again?" "but you may not speak"  Now we eat lunch
      silently and sit next to each other.
  - negative 17 - why do you dislike the charcters when all the others seem
    to love them?
    - there is an element of he's in the interesting charming weido, and I'm
      the loaner weirdo. (weirdo jealously) I'ev been weird forver, and this
      guy shows up in this jacket with colors.  and so part of me, I'm
      not the only loner weirdo.  and another situation where ALLISON
      is overlooked.  (that's pretty rough)
ALAN
  - What could make me betray this character?
    - I don't think Alan exerts a lot of presure and is supportive.
    - something a little vague - if ALAN were to get in the way of my 
      Treasure Hunting, pretty easy to betray.  (betrayal is more of the
      normal state with 13 year old).      For reputational conveniecne
  - positive - (2) what do you admire but would never tell them
     - history with the circus and clientelle, don't seem to give a shit about
       how others think of you. Thick skin. I don't, and Im jealous of that.
MICHAEL
  - negative table.  what is doing knowingly or unknowingly that hurts you.
    - I think MICHAEL's not just flaunting of wealth, but taking for granted
      of everything, but especially the security with constant food stream
      and needs being met, is like making LOOMIS aware more than he was 
      that he doesn't have any kind of security going.
  - positive (18) when did you first realize you loved (platonic / romatically)
    this charater
    - first time when he was next tothe water fountain, and something about
      him - I have no idea what's going on with my body right now, if I could
      get past this boy's name that sounds like a disease, would love to ask
      him to Prom / Sadie Hawkins.  

Motivations:
   - There was an incident at the circus that involved LOOMIS's parents, and
     LOOMIS suspects maybe was propagated by someoen else in the circus, all
     who he considered family and trusted, he's a little bit lost.
     Hopes to uncover somethign about that. Something that will solve it,
     won't bring his parents back, vinidcated / explain.  

Fears:
   - afraid of the universe turning against him, being deeply unlucky.
   - join the club, abandoned and alone, has literally been.  not in a
     general emotional sense, but in a physical starving sense.
     Being alone from peoeople - not phased by that. Used to all kinds of things.

Backpack:
  - always have my lucky rocks with me - geodes, collected over different
    travels. worked out which ones bring luck.
  - good set of scarves
  - small set of juggling balls
  - small set of throwing knives / stars / circus performer

Specific-questions:
  - Circle Q connection
    - what do you do there, how's your relationship with Mahmoud
    - early on, the propetary caught me shoplifting there, but was
      off the one small shelf with regular grocery supplies - like an
      apple and a water.  ended up working out a deal, He gives me
      deal on food, and go by there to get food / groceries
    - do some cleanup for him several times a week (inside, ALLISON is
      outside)

Life:  
  - Fostered by someone at the church.  Would explain him knowing GRACE
    - taken at the church, been awkward since my both belifes and knowledge/
      experience don't line up at all.  BUT they gave me a room and a bed,
      and I can't possibly complain
    - like Dan and Jane Brown - older, their kids are grown, we have this room
     that John doesn't use, he has kids in ohio, we'd love to hae you
    - kind of tired and worn, stay out of their hair, and they let me do
      my own thing.  Way better than being under an overpass

Favorite teacher at the school and what did they do.
  - Civics - the conspiracy theorist in Loomis, finding out about these levers
    of powers.  The civics teacher is delighted to have one student who cares.
    (or at least appears to care)
    - Dr Jill Bohn. my favorite - not sure if she's actuallky a doctor, but
      that's whateveryone calls her

Chief Kelly - what did he do? 
  I think I tried to break in to office of
  - Board of Supervisors, both school board and the city boad, not sure whcih,
    hacking in for grades, or city, but got caught breaking in.
    The explanation was incoherent, and they were at a loss. may hae been
    mention of lizards and weather balloons, and didn't make a whole lot of sense.

Worst thing youv'e done for arcade money
  - by who's measure? :-)
  - ALAN remember when your birthday money went missing.  NO YOU'RE KIDDING
    (grace: he has so little already. We're crul, but that's downright
    dispicable. and he feels bad about it all the time. WHen he was offering 
    food from his backpack.

----------

GRACE: eyes going to dart around
  - difficutly 3, Brains
  - if mahmoud fine and murder not in the gas station 

Officer Kelly, Come here
Alan says "what did you do?"  worst death glare
Grace 'clean up a body' death glare'

"have you seen anything intrestng in the area, as cleaning up the"

some people coming on, out of towners, stopped for gas, a couple of 
days in a row.  Mahmood didn't seem concerned, but I didn't seme concerned

Wild man - what does he look like.  6'2, thin, just add to the weirdness
of the vibe.  Clothes although appropraite dingy for his life style, are
not ragged, he has a beard, not quick to smile, and also not mean or
grimicing.

Feel like ALLISON interacts with him potentially more regularly than most
folks in town, because of his clean-up. She's never creeped out by him.
He's unusual not creepy.  And she knows the difference between the two
(insightful for a 13 year old). other people "oooh wild man" and "he's fine",
she gets weird looks about how not weird he is, and she's stopped acknowedged.
When officer Kelly, have you seen th Wild Man lately.

"I saw him a couple of days ago wit ha coke and a chicken tendie. We chatted
a little bit about the cleanup around the creek a day before that. He noticed
a bunch of trash was gone, and thanked you for it."

you don't sound like a small cheief.

ALLISON is nodding in agreement with mahmoud.


LOOMIS looking around, indication of what
  - trying to case the scene, skirting the tape, looking for evidence
    of the body who was murdered.  DOn't think Loomis has thought through
    when sees the body.  Recently had close exposure to another crime scene
    looking for clues
  
EMILY - sneaking around and getting a smurfee
  - opposite side 
  - assuming front, skirt around, and go off othe cement in the high
    heels, in to the grass to sneak around and use the bushes
    to get to the side
MICHAEL - sneaking around and 

Diffficultly 8 FLIGHT
GRACE - 7 + 1 AT
MICHAEL - 3
  UP TO FOUR

"can you get me some more Kools, almost out"
  "want the crushed ones that smell like mint"

ALAN - when been to the clinic, before school, and visit folks / bring from
house, his instructions, you stand there, touch nothihg, talk to nobody,
we got medical stuff going on here, don't mess it it up. 

what does MICAHEL do? telling grace what my order, and talking too lout

door.
Difficulty 10 FLIGHT
 - LOOMIS - 8 
 - + 1 AT == 5

an adult male, limbs weird angle, and cover goes over it.
  - freeze when I see that, and take some steps backwards
  - do not get shooed.

difficutly 8 brains
  - LOOMIS - 15
  - This is Jimmy's father
  - that's a lot for a 13 year old.
    - wasn't expeceting
  - will resist the urge to just run away.  takes me a little
    bit, look around the tarp

inside the parking space markers.
  - make the way back to the group.

GRACE
  - going into the circle Q.
  - go in, go to the smurfee machine, get two XL smurfees, a pack of diet
    winterfresh gum, and check around, and see if he can see in, and then
    try to navigate the cigareet wall as best as I can to figure out which
    are the kools that Michael has asked for.  Will be the marlboro blues.
  (it's fine, I won't know the difference either),
  - put a $10 bill on the counter  "this should be enough, right for 2 smurfees
    cigs, and a pack of gum"
  - and sneak back outside, and sneak back.
  - have them held behind my back to keep from being seen.

how far from cars
  - ALAN - sticking near officer kelly, but listening in to any converstaion.
  - GRACE and Michael - watching grace.  as soon as get back. so we can go,
    here's your smurfee, picked up an extra straw just in case.

"We can hear everything you're saying, just leave"

GRACE: "dod they think the guy who eats dogs did this?"
MICHAEL: if he eats dogs, he's up for anhthing, so maybe we should go
   before he kills us.  
LOOMIS: Its just convenient when follow the rules. you stole smurfess
GRACE: we paid for it
L: looking at a dead body, lost my appetite
L looks like a you issue.  
  You know that kid jimmy king,
:OMG is jummy dead
L: It's mister king.  There was a hole in his head. it was so gross

ALAN - seeing if the body goes to the clinic or the morgue
G I think the clinic only goes living peopole. 
Is the doctor the mortition?
  Checked out before getting put on ice.

See when the body comes back from.

"guns / archery" - 
  - I've never seen him any meat. He doesn't even eat hot dogs.
  - they're not very meat?
  - anyone who spends time in the woods, implying that she also has a knife,
    everyone has knives.

Doctor at the clinic
 - Dr Chelsey myers, larger hospitoals the chife of medicine, runes the
   hospital, probably not planning on working tonight, but would someone
   else in for emergencies off hours, but murder is infrequent enough
   officer kelly insisted, she's from out of town, in part to pay off
   student debt, go to a rural place, the government pays off part of your
   loans, doesn't love serving in a small town, but wants to get back to
   the city.
   Been here.  Maybe six-seven years.  Not super long, but knows everyone,
   but still an outside, but refuses to embrace small town life.

back to the school 

car is idling.

how big is the school.
G:
  - has a like a side door you can get in to
  - he's looking for us, knows we're missing, pretend going to the bathroom,
    "We just went to the bathroom mr kelly"
M: do you think Jimmy knows?  
G: I think it just happened.  I dunno,   new key, you should tell him
   might be good news.  You're new
M: that would be respect fuk to let him know
L: whatever.  going to grab one of my lucky rocks in the bag
G: Jimy is inside, not in your backpack
L: I'm not stupid.  I jut don't know
   if that's the move
M: should we ask him?
L: I don't want him, and his dad's just gone.
(you're a foster kid, you probably get it)
  - rocks was not a good idea
L: some parents better off not being here.  We shoujld get back into
   the cleaning stuff
G: we should not kill people's parents
M: back to parents
G: I think I need to tell your foster parents you think foster parents are
   ok.
G: Get the busted up wire hanger, untwist it, jimmy

Mr Kilian didn't even notice them.

   "I guess that's taken car off"
