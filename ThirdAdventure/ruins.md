### Figboot / Punita Scene

You see a middle-aged dude sitting at a desk, writing in a notebook. You recognize
Figboot.  Knock on the door. "Come in".  A short grey-haired human, dot on the forehead.
Warm smiles.  Hugs. "how was your trip to Castle-Lantern?"

"Really nice.  They've got a lovely library there.  I had a great time chatting with
Arma and Darrell and checking out their stacks"  "find anything?"  "yes!  I think I have
lead on the second book.  Thinking it may be within a couple of miles of the Delian tomb"

"Anything else going on there?  I dispatched a team up there earlier this week after
a pretty inchoerent cry for help".  "no, everything seemed normal.  Had a nice meal at
their weird little restaurant. Apparently some kids discovered an ancient encampment 
outside of town. The head of the guard and the mayor where arguing over whether they should
investigate it.  He's an ass."

"Really." Figboot looks concerned.  He waves his hand at the door
connecting his office to the tavern. It opens by itself.  "BozLee?  If
you've got a minute."  Floon's voice comes from offstage "He's still
running that audition. They're kinda slow".  "Damn"

### Drive to the Ruin

(Assuming folks are wanting to drive to the ruin)

- Figuing out mechanics
- get part way
  - maybe destroy the corner of a building on the way out
- Hear the thing laboring. It's not moving quickly
  - battery running out
  - If they look at the crystal (red corundum elemental gem. Related to ruby and sapphire)
    it's dimming with load
- If they keep going, it dies in a farmer's field
  - "oh hey Yansha"
  - "you heading to the woods?  Things are getting weird over there.  Be careful"
- need to walk to the forest and to the ruins
- Far end of the fields
