# Forest encounters

THE FOREST OF ANACRHONISMS


* A great stag spots the PCs as they move through the woodland, it
  pauses briefly before darting away into the trees.

* The air in this area is full of tinkling, high-pitched laughter and
  whispers, the characters feel their clothes tugged by unseen hands
  and they are tripped by an invisible foe. This area is the lair of
  1D12 Sprites, whilst playful and annoying they are not actually
  evil, if the PCs are genuinely good-hearted, are elven or show good
  humour then the Sprites will eventually reveal themselves and will
  provide a small token of their appreciation before disappearing to
  make sport of someone else.  (roll on trinket table)

* A great and partially collapsed tree squats here, the trunk
  resembles a frowning face when seen in a certain light. In-fact the
  trunk is an ancient Treant who has long been occupied with a
  particular question, listening closely to the tree may enable the
  PCs to hear a low grumbling voice musing on the question. If the PCs
  can answer it then the Treant will rouse and may be able to provide
  the heroes with knowledge on ancient lore concerning the forest
  since it has dwelt here for hundreds of years.

* The ruins of a forest hermits hut can be encountered here, they are
  overgrown but it is clear from the disarray inside and some bones
  scattered around that the hermit met an unfortunate end. Searching
  the hut may reveal some random items of minor import and also a copy
  of the hermit’s journal where he talks about a CREATURE OF MANY
  MOUTHS DRAWING CLOSER IN HIS DREAMS

* A sprite throws a glittery dust bomb at the shortest member of the
  party and disappears. That night a ~female~ male mountain lion nuzzles up
  to them and is very friendly. Too friendly…
  - whomever is on watch doesn't notice the mountain lion enter the
    circle of sleepers. Before they can relax, it curls up next to
    the PC and goes to sleep

* Deep in the woods you find a sword lodged in a stone surrounded by
  thorny vines that drip poison.

* A Warforged holding an ax has rusted near a felled tree. If only
  someone could find his oil can and free him up

* A werebear wearing a pair of jeans and a park ranger hat with
  “SMOGGY” written on it approaches the party and gives them a 1D10
  hour lecture on how you should be careful using fire or fire related
  spells in forest areas. Once finished, he tells the party “Only YOU
  can prevent a forest fire.” and proceeds to ride off on the back of
  an owlbear.
