Sash of the Balanced Soul
This plain seeming black cloth sash is unassuming made from a simple
weave and adorned with a necklace of prayer beads along it’s
front. However, if investigated for magic it will demonstrate a
magical field that defies easy categorization into the classic
schools. When worn no apparent effect is had.

However, if during a long rest the wearer enters a meditation they
will feel the sash pull at their consciousness, trying to instill a
certain sense of peace and well being. If the user fights this it will
immediately back off and the sensation disappear, but if the used is
able to make a wisdom check DC 10 they will lull into a sense of
supreme balance.

The following morning they will find their balance is easy and more
natural then before, and tripping is now virtually impossible. The
user gains advantage on all Dex saves to determine balance or keeping
their footing, as well as checks against being knocked prone or being
moved by a force. If this ability is used five times in a day the
connection with the belt dissipates and must be regained on a long
rest.

If, at the end of the day their emotional state is off balance they
must recommend with the sash to reclaim a sense of balance.p
