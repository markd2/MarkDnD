## Levels

### Outside

* A one-story building, kind of like [this image](assets/tower.jpg) but
  with enclosd walls.  You do see a (paper) door on one side.

* Handout of origami tower



----------
### Level 1 - Comfortable Parlor

- Prior to expanding, consists only of this single cozy room.
- Squishy armchairs, lavishly intricate rug, popping fireplace
- Stairway going up to the ceiling (?)
- Unremarkable, amicable man
- welcoming. Shares stores of the exotic accoutrement on his shelves between
  dusty tome
- "Wrong Question"
- If things get uncomfortable, pulls a hanging rope that unfolds the paper walls
  to form the upper stories.   Dude is yaked upwards to the roof, as the ceiling
  seals. The stairway now goes to the second floor.


----------
### Level 2 - Illuminated Ballroom

- Beautifully crafted gold chandelier reflects from the highly polished (waxed)
  floor in this open room.  Magically-lit candles flutter lazily.
- Candles are wax elementals - first line of defense in the tower
- Heat from the candeles make the heavily waxed floor to get melty, creating
  difficult terrain.


----------
### Level 3 - Sparse Study

- Thin sheets of paper are stacked neatly atop a simple teak desk, with an opaque
  inkwell.
- opening the drawer activates a sliding trap.  As it opens an two inches, you
  hear a loud ~click~ ripping sound. If they finish opening the drawer, a rip
  appears in the floor, chuting down into the basement.
- Falling and getting paper cuts
- The drawer (when they come back) has a relic, Sharpened Shears of Forcenius


----------
### Level 4 - Cluttered Stacks

- Scores of books lie in scattered heaps througout the room, discarded, torn up.
- Anyone crossing through becomes assaulted by illusory characters from well-known
  tales. (stat blocks for the first 3 done)

- Monster table

| D6 | Book | Monster |
| :---: | ------- | ------ |
| 1 | _Tiny Rose Walking Cloak_ | Mangy, Muscular Wolf |
| 2 | _Cutie and the Monster_ | Horned Devil dressed in finery |
| 3 | _The Goblin Spinster_ | Mischievous Redcap |


| 4 | _Cows to Beans: A Calculated Study_ | Throttling Vines |
| 5 | _A Disobedient Puppet_ | Deranged Mannequin |
| 6 | _The Amphibious Boy-King_ | Swarm of Poisonous Frogs |


----------
### Level 5 - Wyrm's-Eye View

* Falthier is up here
* Vityliax - fearsome shard-breathing dragon hovers overhead, awaiting orders.
* defeating the wizard yields a key to the parlor chest, which has
    - spellbook (unreadable)
    - sheet of Unending Parchment
    - quills of forethought
    - small fortune of gold


----------
### Basement - Crude Dungeon

* Faux-stone (ORIGAMI BOULDERS)
* incredibl sharp paper shards jut out from the floor in the center of the chamber
* Hefty granite boulder chained to the wall (big paper weight). Actually a sentient
  Rock Golem, named _GORU_, imprisoned to show his dominance over the element
* Ladder will desend if GORU is freed - chain is attached to a hidden pulley system
    - That doesn't make sense (not that anything here makes sense :-) )
    - Couldn't GORU pull the chain? Why open the ceiling when The Enemy is released?




## Session Start

Scene from POV of one of the PCs (hopefully one with a magic or speacial weapon)

* Seeing a giant lizard next to pen of cows
    - Bugbear scooping dinopoop
    - Dwarf screaming at the monster, monster screaming back
    - Two folks observing. One looks druidy and occasionally screams
    - Another one looking very concerned
* Feel a buzzing on your finger
    - When you're looking for work, put it on.  Like a midieval pager
* Start wandering to Figboot's tavern
* Before you get there, you see Azizah Ironhamer running out of Figboot's with
  a party of RatCatchers following her
    - "Oh my God! They've kidnapped Xander!" 
    - You've met Xander.  Good kid.  He really enjoy these "kidnappings"
* See a familiar Goblin hangin out on Figboot's front porch, enjoying a somke.
  It's Boz Lee, Figboot's assistant.
  "Hey BozLee.  How's it going"
  "Eh, got another audition. Hope this group is better than the last one.  Hey,
   Figboot's looking for ya.  Come on"  Boz Lee leads character through the 
   tavern ($DESCRIPTION) and into a familiar office. You see a bunch of folks
   you've hung out with in Nextia.  Gone on errands for Figboot.
* INTRO(E)S

Box text:

Things are getting strange in $TOWN_NAME.  Unexplainable circumstances have
the village in a tizzy!  Pigs turned to paper!  Exceptional stationery stolen!
Tales torn from Tantalizing Tomes!  Rumors suggest that these events happen in the
wake of visits from an elderly man who roams the region.

Dude is a papermancer named Falthier, doesn't appear to have a
permanent residence, but hunters have repored sightings of a
collapsible hut that literally seems to pop out of nowhere.


## Things happening in Woolstream and environs

* Livestock turned into origami
* School / Library / rich person
* maybe as heroes enter town, there's a town-square meeting with the mayor
    - "my pigs are two-dimensional!:
    - Librarian - some books have been gutted or outright stolen
         - fiction books.  history books unaffected.
    - Store owner - the francy stationery and postcards are gone
    - saw an elderly man pass through town
    - someone from out of town witnessed the same thing
    - hunter faction from another town saw similar things - livestock,
      paper kind of disappearing.  Oh yeah, there was an older dude
      dressed in purple came through
    - Two miles out of town to the southwest, there's a wird house
* If the players just go through the forest, can get similar stories and
  similar poitner

* Dude's motivations
    - general mayhem isn't good
    - maybe he's looking for something, why he's scraping the old books
    - and he needs the blank stationery for raw materials
    - why are critters being turned into origami?
    - what would be the WRONG QUESTION?
    - what would make him go against the party?
    - so must be doing something kind of shady
    - maybe the e.g. pigs are an unintended side-effect
    - "apotheosis"?
    - so figure he's on the evil side, or maybe cluelessly selfish?
      (but... wrong question...)
    - so what can he accomplish via papermancy?
    - Paper elementals?  Accessing elemental Plane of Paper?
    - maybe he's trying to weaken the Prime Material / Plane of Paper
      boundary?
      - ooh, maybe the books in the upper floor are portals, channeling the
        given elemental creature
    - still... why?
