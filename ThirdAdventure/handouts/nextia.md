# Nextia

Nextia, barely registering as a bump in the road through the [NAME]
frontier. Support area for a large cluster of farms. Sitting beside
the Yawkna river, several days hard travel south of the city of Hookhill,
the hamlet of HochHoch, and the turnip-farming town of Orlane, themselves
considered the backwater of the region. _actual region is handwavey_

The environs are pretty much unknown and unexplored, home to
civilizations long gone. The draw of danger, adventure, and treasure,
bring ratcatchers to this region. Each on their own personal missions
from redemption, to vengeance, to greed, and sometimes all three.

Coming in from the north, see farms with grain, fields of various
livestock. The road is cobblestone in places, bare dirt in others. It
too a relic of times past, often succumbing to mud. Luckily it's past
the mud season. There's a pen with a gigantic lizard (etc)
