1. 53. The road is crossed by many animal tracks, as if a herd of beasts all crossed at the same time.

2. 55. A traveling peddler sells animated toys.

3. 1. As the party passes beneath a large oak that has grown over the road, a branch swoops down and snatches the backpack from one of your group. The tree proves vocally petulant when you attempt retrieval, tossing the bag from one branch to another.

4. 5. One of the PCs spots a key. What's it for?

5. 12. A strange smell comes from the bushes.
