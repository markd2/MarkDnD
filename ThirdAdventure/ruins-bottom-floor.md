# Bottom Floor

This is the research and technology floor.  They were doing somewhat unpleasant
research on local flora/fauna/fey. Some results in mechanical / animal hybrids
(stuff from Starfinder) or rather horrble animal (the gibberator)

The starfinder critters escaped out

Every room has airducts

### 1 - Stairs

Stairs from kobold lair.  It's open to room 2

### 2 - Main control room

* THere's three large metal tables
* A number of consoles.  Blinking a lock code.  A keycard will unlock them.
* There's a nice poster?  map?  on the wall.  The detail is quite exquisite
  (wall-map)
* monitors for small critter research and large critter research
* Lights are bright and steady

### 3 - Small Critter Reasearch

* hallway is dim, lights flickering, getting worse as it goes back
* Room is unpowered
* six empty cages, no front doors (because power off)
  - detritus, bones
  - one has a ${decayed starfinder critter}



### 4 - Large Critter research

* Larger cages
* The ShadowTiger from the top floor was in the west-most cage
  - black filligree on the wall
  - the one the players saw was the only one (so sad)
  - nothing over the entrance
* The west-most cage is empty, but has the entrance sealed
* The middle cage has the gibberator
  - the stasis field is active    
  - the blocking field is active


Gibberator
- intelligent and psionic
- need to make sure it doesn't get rapey
- Jessica and ring-heat
- Bargain : "oooh, a sender" (loud, everyone but Jessica hears an echo)
- 20 eyes / mouths
  - 1/4 turn on bargain
  - All turn on Jessica
  - "I can't sense you.  fascinating"
- It can split up and reform
- air ducts

### 5 - Admin and Control

- lots of consoles, with lots of camera angles of things in the cages.
- controls for machinery


### 6 - Engineering Closet

- Large powerfully glowing crystal
- recharger, large enough to hold the Drill's crystal
  - top is smashed
- multiple sizes
- smaller one, same diameter, in use, glowing
  - will need to take the top off to charge the drill
  - which drops power to the whole facility
- Some things kind of burned up
- Some scorches on teh wall near the broken ones
