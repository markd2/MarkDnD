  - see a spark coming from the sconses
    - 1-in-3 chance of them catching the oil on fire
* 1 in 4 chance per turn of seeing some paper on the ground
  - in that strange writing
  - three edges cut, one torn  (from another Thesaurus)

* Graffiti continues
  - YOU STAY OUT


## G3 - Auditorium

Partial power on this level - dim light

### 1 - Entry way

* has kobold graffiti. Floor is dusty, vegetative detritus

  iconography

* unremarkable. Dusty


### 4 - SHUPAC lobby entrance

* Can hear voices (chatting) out beyond the doors
* Small table with flyers - About 10 pages.  Front page has smiling Peersa faces, and
  objects. Might be musical instruments?

### 5 - Auditorium

* the crude lines are rows of seats

* The bandits are goths who are doing low-key smuggling / theft in the area, using the
  forest as a base.  _(although these are kind of a long way away from civilization)_
  - They're really late-teens hanging out.  The smuggling is just a fabrication

* Hear some occasionall screetching from back stage / alternating with singing

* "I don't know why we picked this place. It's noisy.  Got that smelly ugly bird back
  there, and the screamies across the hall.  Can't even hear my poetry"  "Hey, it's your turn
  to feed Noisy"  "Not until later. She just got a rat"

* "Leader" has three ID cards. Sometimes idly playing with them.

* Faces on the cards (all with Peersa hair)
  - Emily
  - Leo/Happy
  - Arthur - has a full head of hair.  unpleasant expression on face.
    - obviously a mutant

* Maybe could be like the Saltmarsh Merkilites.
* Names
  - DeathBringer - the leader, lishps
  - Discord - yes man
  - Strife - moody
  - BlackSkull - the quiet one.  This is the one Yansha knows
  - Ephemera - kind of the scary murderer type
  - Venus (no!  You're Shadows!) - youngest

- Goth followers of Myrkul - the lord of bones
  - Religion check - an ancient god, most folks have forgotten about him
    - Lord of Bones, the Reaper, God of the Dead
    - originally mortal man, a necromancer, ascended into godnood
    - lived in the Bone Castle until usurpt by some other god (Kelemvor), still spicy about that
    - he is waiting for us all when we die
    - avatar is a skeleton in flowing black robes
    - holy symbol is a white skull inset into a black triangle    
    - speaks in a high whisper, though words never showed inflection
    - Bane and Bhaal are often mentioned, but they are pretty much forgotten

The Kobolds are friendly enough.  Pretty stupid. Just don't question their ruing hierarchy.
   - ALL HAIL KING TORG! (laughs)

Yansha recognizes BlackSkull (a.k.a. Stannard Billings)
  - one of the kids that didn't come back
  - got chased by a guy on an owlbear
    - turned out it wanted to talk about fire safety
  - came back, met the other folks. They're here collecting the harpy poop backstage.
    Myrkyl's kind of cool. I hated my folks anyway, and castle-lantern is so dull.
  - The group wanders around, finds Harpies, hangs out and feeds them, befriends then,
    and collects the poop, until they have a a full load, then take it to hookhill for a lot
    of money.
  - their last order was placed about six months ago.

Hopefully the party will remember Harpy Poop (that'd be Sam / Mui / Lauren).
Y looks a little concerned.  "what... what's the deal with harpy poop.  Moose said
Gwatney was looking for some, but none was available"

* About to pack up, especially because Squishy is dead
* before they leave, a Kobold comes with a note from Leader Flunkins
  - "Defbringer, 
     hey we found new floor. U wanna see?
    ~Chu~ Leeder Flunkins"

* Poetry Slam

```
hey all think they're smarter than me
and treat me like some kind of baby
    i do have a brain
    that i try to train
so please don't treat me abysmally 

"gah"
i'm tired of all my friends
their pettiness reaches no end
    they quibble and fight
    and rarely are right
why even try to amend? 

"hmmmmm"
i know that you are not a lover
just like i'm not much of a fighter
    you have to be strong
    and we'll get along
the future will be that might brighter 

"feh"
sometimes loneliness is the cure
a meaningful traffic detour
    i'll sit all alone
    prop up my chinbone
purge all that is in me impure 

they sit there so damn self absorb-ed
and talk so conceited and morbid
    i'm tired of this
    real friendship i miss
but depending on people is sordid 


my friends they think i'm explosive
personality something corrosive
    they think i'm too deep
    when i break down and weep
the feelings i sense are implosive


you and your untouchable face
damn existing in the first place
    am i asking too much
    to be vying for your touch
it's turning my heart into paste 
```

etc etc etc
