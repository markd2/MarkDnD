Jessica notes

what was fun
  - Jessica Jones - in marvel universe "the defenders". On netflix.
    Like her as a character. A comic book character. Shoehorning into
D&D universe.  

Had run in with mind-control creature. "oh yeah, we can talk telepathically,
family was killed" - (maybe by the creature).  She was under mind control.
Unable to help that demise. The crature left, pulled it together enough
to come out and adventure.  Trying to make money, side quest to
find the creature and kill it.

highly inquisitive - JJ in the marvel jones a PI, Also drunk most of the
time, and in the marvel world - strong, super powers, can't fly, can
jump.  Almost controlled falling.  sneak in situations and gather
informatin, if needed will step in a big way.  5'11", tall for a
human - a half elf.  dispite her deep-seated rage, she also feels
strongly about helping others, especially underdogs, I was taken advtange
of, and want to make sure other people taken advantage in other ways.
Just doesn't trust anybody.  didn't expect sam dynamic, dudn't make
as much fun. friends who ahve writte nbooks - I don't know what we're
doing.
