# Kobold Floor

* Kobolds At My Baby is canon
* This floor is infested with dozens, if not hundreds of them.

This floor was support for the labs below ground.  A couple of scientists, a couple
of troops.  An administrator or two.  They generally didn't mix much with the
ambassadorial staff.

Although the chief ambassador was also the leader of this section as well.  Their
ID cards open all the doors here and below.


### 1 - Main hallway

* A couple of kobold guards at either end
* Folks milling around, going from room to room, espeially kitchen (6) and Chunk
  Flunkins room (9)

### 2 - Library

* A thesaurus like thing came out of here once.  Killed a bunch before it escaped upstairs
  - that's why they put all the traps there
  - "wouldn't that just encourage it to stay inside here?"  uh....  you smart
* Lots of book shelves.  All the books on the floor or tossed around.  All defaced in a familiar
  manner

### Clearning of the level

* While talking to Leader Flunkins for a while, someone will come up
  - looks frightend
  - everyone knows that Kobolds are too stupid to be frightened of anything
  - "hey chunk?  uh... you need to see something downstairs"
  - goes down with a sychophant or two

* 10 minutes later
  - hear a scream from downstairs
  - see the sycophants hightailing it down the hall, still screaming
  - Chunk's frightened
  - "We... gotta get out of here now.  EVERYONE LET'S GO!"
    - still a cacophony
  - "EVERYONE LET'S GO. SCREW KING TORG!"
    - sielnce
    - EVERYONE OUT. SCREW KING TORG!
  - and the place clears out in 30 seconds
  -eerily quiet...
