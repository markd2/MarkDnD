## Obligatory RP Jazz

Bulsai is nearly square - as wide as tall due to a ton of strength -
too much time at the gym and never skipping leg day. Or arm day. Or
neck day.

Unlike other dwarves he keeps his hair under control -
buzzcut, goatee, black.  It's more intimidating that way.  Dark,
piercing gaze that can assess a chaotic situation (he is a bouncer in
a popular tavern, after all).  He goes armor-less, a black leather
outfit more akin to what a rogue would wear.

His parents are alive and he gets along well with them now. He tries
annually to drop by $DWARVEN_AREA_IN_THIS_WORLD for a visit. Father's
name is Spøt Targét, and his mother is Retâile Targét. The father is a
stonecutter (skilled, but uninspired) and she's an accountant. No
other siblings.  He puts away some money and brings it home to them.

During his rebellious years, he fell in with a cross-species gang,
using his strength for thuggery and intimidation. During these years
his path crossed with Charlie's, and they occasionally would team up
for bigger heists.  His strength and her intelligence and acrobatic
skill made them a powerful team.  After each gig they go their
separate ways until crossing paths again.  Bulsai treats her like a
sister. (double-checked with Amanda for veracity of this part of the
backstory)

His regular job is bouncer at The Iron Bar, a popular tavern / night
club in $SEEDY_PART_OF_TOWN. He gets paid, plus has a room on the
second floor, exchanging work for a place to stay.  For fun and extra
money (and to advertise The Iron Bar) he goes busking, performing
feats of strength and making balloon-animal style figures out of
literal iron bars.  He also does contact-juggling, using the Continual Flame
he got in Fizzik The Beholder's lair as the object being juggled.

He gets wanderlust, and takes off adventuring to get the general rage
out of his system, then floats back to the bar. The owner has been
through a couple of cycles of this, and it's just part of what he is.
He's a good bouncer, so they keep him around.

### The Iron Bar

The Iron Bar is a bar and night club in the seedy part of town.  It has
regular bands and other performers, along with a healthy alcohol supply.
It can get pretty rowdy, but Bulsai is there as head bouncer.  (Recall the
Mr. T scenes in A-Team where the bad guys give ineffectual gut-punches before
Mr. T throws them across the room - he's like that.)

Randrum Amberhill - Owner of the Iron Bar. Dwarf, older and
greying. Ran around in the same gang that Bulsai was in (he got out
before Bulsai joined). Mentor figure - discovered Bulsai's artistic and
entertainment skills, and uses him as an advertisement for the bar

### Fire, Walk with Me

X months/years ago, while adventuring with the party, he got separated.
Reality twisted around and he was separated from his friends. For years
(subjetively) he was wandering a disturbing hellscape.  Few memories beyond
simple survival.  He was returned to our reality temporally just a few weeks
from his disappearance, and returned to his life.

He met up with DragonBallZ at the $FESTIVAL, where he was making scultures.
During a brief reality-twist, he was able to emit a fireball (really it was
just a firebolt).  That was when he figured he had talent for fire magic,
and since then spends his spare time looking for fire-related artifacts, and
when he can (privately) exercise his few spells, requiring the Pince-nez of
Knowing™ to do any of it.
