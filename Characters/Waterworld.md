# Step's Game

Zach Simon, Shannon, Mikey, Bork, Waldowski and Drew

All in a guild of sorts, simplifies things, assignments, and early.  Would love to
weave a tapestry of worldbuilding.  Not something a DM can do and everyone on that
page, and requires a lot more time.  Can't help but provide some rich world build,
hoping to make a fun sandbox - like the accidents so far.

Primary goal, initially Mikey's BD.  Have an adventure and an endpoint to get to.
The world will be going to a certain point.  And figure out what we do.

Any rate, want to tell teh story and make a rich sandbox, and have a chnace to
hang out with Mikey.  Folks like Daram, and everone love a good goof or too.

Monk sounds not too far afield - more work to do.

Step - definitely into monks - bruce lee

Warlock is great.  Work wonderfully. Hexblade.   

Darker side of things.

SC: not going heavily dark, tend to a bit of darker stories.  GOing to keep this one
    from going too dark.  but my patron, plenty of room for that.  Maybe a spooky vibe.
    Little haloweenie, but keep in the oooh spooky. But not add too much despair.

usually warlock don't.

Promise of a fairly quick resolution.  Have that knowledge from the party.  Also
true doesn't have to be the case.  Or lesser or greater degree.

still have some room to play, as soon as message didn't think 30 min how I think
is going to plug in some ways.  A lot of within that high-arcing connection
part, some room.

[ ] patron - known or not know, or party secreet / not secret.

and backstory, and parts to flesh out.  Leave some nice DM sized holes.
Describe what the character saw, and leave that room there. May not be what they
saw.  Maybe missing information.

[ ] environment - what kind of world? Standard fantasy

humblewood - one of the island. Giant Tree, alderheart, has the main city.
isaland with a full forest and a giant forest.  Or where we will be early on.
Will be going from island to island in this waterworld.  The activity will be
at least be on the island - there's possibility of extra planar, depending on
party composition, and where the BBEG is and what it is.

Will say the motivating event, world is undergoing cataclysitmic event, and immediate
and fear of natural disaster - but nope someone made a misteak and we get to
fix it.

Will have a fixed clock before the world comes apart.

plenty of external motiviation to deal with problems. Do want all of us to
be heroic creature / characters that want to run twoards rather than away.


Communication - telepathy is a fitting method. All the other things describe work
as well.  Feel free to get a little creative.

Also don't have to come up with - the patron can also provide what that looks like.

[ ] come up with some key elements, how the contract got made, or what I experience that
  led to me having powers, can be as vague as in CR - "I saw a giant eye when drawogin
  and now I'm powerful on the beach -weird and cool that's what I know" ,adn developed
  from there.  

  Can pick out some key things that would be cool details, and go further.

powers - like ghost spooky, or mind powers, water/fire/air/etc.


SC: there will be some strange Fey influence, a lot of beast and things taht should be 
normal are not normal.  e.g. if had background as a botanist or an arborists, then
a way to divine meeting from strange plants, flower has change in this way.

(oooh - FLOWER CHILD).  

[X] Humblewood - don't need to worry about spoilers  WOn't use the plots elements in the same
    way.  Borrow inspiration, but won't be humbleswood.  IF read the whole thing, may
    recognize characters.  Not expecting if any other players will do that.  

Mikey loves Chronotrigger - exists iOS version

think more about background and where to go, SC will be fleshing details out shortly.
Working on a daily basis.

Won't be staying in humblewood, if get knowledge, have some knowledge of the starto f the
world, will move a lot faster than our RnD.

Be really cool like Reptile God, 8-12 week segments, and we rotate through DMing.
Make new characters.

----------

rendezvous on discord.  

thinking.  straight, not multiclass

4th level - yes.  QUestion dark - one ultimate dark direction is being required enticed
to betray party?  Not fond of.  But what if asked that, not going with that, and needing
to forge a new path.  not understood the bargain - that.  DOn't like the activley harming
the the party.  

Also groups that could pull that off.  Mikey and Shannon two peope who would be members.

Goody-Goody type - going to be a challenge.  DMing we all struggle with, introducing
and sustaining real conflict, and meanness, which the DM has to have villains, just not
really in our nature to understand that.
