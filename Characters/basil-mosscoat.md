# Step's Game

Zach Simon, Shannon, Mikey, Bork, Waldowski and Drew

All in a guild of sorts, simplifies things, assignments, and early.  Would love to
weave a tapestry of worldbuilding.  Not something a DM can do and everyone on that
page, and requires a lot more time.  Can't help but provide some rich world build,
hoping to make a fun sandbox - like the accidents so far.

Primary goal, initially Mikey's BD.  Have an adventure and an endpoint to get to.
The world will be going to a certain point.  And figure out what we do.

Any rate, want to tell teh story and make a rich sandbox, and have a chnace to
hang out with Mikey.  Folks like Daram, and everone love a good goof or too.

Monk sounds not too far afield - more work to do.

Step - definitely into monks - bruce lee

Warlock is great.  Work wonderfully. Hexblade.   

Darker side of things.

SC: not going heavily dark, tend to a bit of darker stories.  GOing to keep this one
    from going too dark.  but my patron, plenty of room for that.  Maybe a spooky vibe.
    Little haloweenie, but keep in the oooh spooky. But not add too much despair.

usually warlock don't.

Promise of a fairly quick resolution.  Have that knowledge from the party.  Also
true doesn't have to be the case.  Or lesser or greater degree.

still have some room to play, as soon as message didn't think 30 min how I think
is going to plug in some ways.  A lot of within that high-arcing connection
part, some room.

[ ] patron - known or not know, or party secreet / not secret.

and backstory, and parts to flesh out.  Leave some nice DM sized holes.
Describe what the character saw, and leave that room there. May not be what they
saw.  Maybe missing information.

[ ] environment - what kind of world? Standard fantasy

humblewood - one of the island. Giant Tree, alderheart, has the main city.
isaland with a full forest and a giant forest.  Or where we will be early on.
Will be going from island to island in this waterworld.  The activity will be
at least be on the island - there's possibility of extra planar, depending on
party composition, and where the BBEG is and what it is.

Will say the motivating event, world is undergoing cataclysitmic event, and immediate
and fear of natural disaster - but nope someone made a misteak and we get to
fix it.

Will have a fixed clock before the world comes apart.

plenty of external motiviation to deal with problems. Do want all of us to
be heroic creature / characters that want to run twoards rather than away.


Communication - telepathy is a fitting method. All the other things describe work
as well.  Feel free to get a little creative.

Also don't have to come up with - the patron can also provide what that looks like.

[ ] come up with some key elements, how the contract got made, or what I experience that
  led to me having powers, can be as vague as in CR - "I saw a giant eye when drawogin
  and now I'm powerful on the beach -weird and cool that's what I know" ,adn developed
  from there.  

  Can pick out some key things that would be cool details, and go further.

powers - like ghost spooky, or mind powers, water/fire/air/etc.


SC: there will be some strange Fey influence, a lot of beast and things taht should be 
normal are not normal.  e.g. if had background as a botanist or an arborists, then
a way to divine meeting from strange plants, flower has change in this way.

(oooh - FLOWER CHILD).  

[X] Humblewood - don't need to worry about spoilers  WOn't use the plots elements in the same
    way.  Borrow inspiration, but won't be humbleswood.  IF read the whole thing, may
    recognize characters.  Not expecting if any other players will do that.  

Mikey loves Chronotrigger - exists iOS version

think more about background and where to go, SC will be fleshing details out shortly.
Working on a daily basis.

Won't be staying in humblewood, if get knowledge, have some knowledge of the starto f the
world, will move a lot faster than our RnD.

Be really cool like Reptile God, 8-12 week segments, and we rotate through DMing.
Make new characters.

----------

rendezvous on discord.  

thinking.  straight, not multiclass

4th level - yes.  QUestion dark - one ultimate dark direction is being required enticed
to betray party?  Not fond of.  But what if asked that, not going with that, and needing
to forge a new path.  not understood the bargain - that.  DOn't like the activley harming
the the party.  

Also groups that could pull that off.  Mikey and Shannon two peope who would be members.

Goody-Goody type - going to be a challenge.  DMing we all struggle with, introducing
and sustaining real conflict, and meanness, which the DM has to have villains, just not
really in our nature to understand that.

after phone chat

* character end fantastically powerful and wealthy. (yeah, I can dig it)
* Think about weird ways of knowing / casting spells
  - since there's a time-roving agent (the PC?), if I need, say, breath underwater,
    can suddenly find that in a ring, or a potion appears on my belt, or
    someone portals in (older/younger looking grumpy but also like the PC), 
    casts it, and then portals out.
* Will be aging at different rates - start of adventure PC will be older than at
  the end, living outside of this time line. The timelines are broad
* Patron meet-cute - at the end of a generally unsuccesful adventure - not
  disasterous.  "The bag of gold *just* slipped out of my hands into the lava"
  or "if I'd just been a little faster, Oleg wouldn't have lost a hand and we
  wouldn't have to pay for a replacement"
  "here let me tell you a little bit about time", camera pulls away with them
  chatting by a campfire.

* Character is fundamentally selfish

[ ] Flavorful magic item
   - some kind of melee weapon.  Maybe an intelligent one? - that could tie in with
     the patron

[ ] who / Foods make you irratable or happy
  - the younger one is omnivorous, "OMG something that's not rations!"
  - the older Basil has become a bit of a food snob, given he's (presumably)
    more successful in latter years.  And the closer it gets to the old days
    of all there was were rations or nomming on monster bodies, the crankier
    he gets.


human(oid) - fine with human
Some flavor of warlock, leaning hexblade, but I still need to research.

* Basil Mosscoat
  - human, from $PLACE
  - hair color / style / vary depending on age and timeline
* Chronomancer warlock
  * Flavorful magic item

Discord chat

ZSimon as a ranger.

those who show up make the rules

main goal is to have fun.
  - sweep the story along before and after.
  - no predetermined outcome
  - "world going down the drain"
  - safety is important
    - stay away from some topics
    - sexual topics / abusive towards kids.
    - trauma can be interesting to explore
    - X in chat or message to fade to black
    - any no-gos (nice ones)
  - in a world called Orub
    - sneak prievew would have seen this sketch in some form.
    - not finely detailed
  - maps
    - islands moving around in this "ocean"
    - forbidden lands
      - mountains area - Nee-pon
      - coloauqial - the pebbles
      - most familiar with / from - Alderheart.  The island and the main city on
        the island.  Gigantic forest with a tree that towers over the trees, and inside
        this TOWERING tree lives an entire bustling city.  large island with small towns,
        rugged forests, different regions, almost a conteinent in itself, not as
        big as a ocntinent, large chunk of land 
        everyone knows of the Heart of Aladerheart
    - some other ideas - set the stage in the
      - planet going down the drain. Big destorying the planet.
      - "we circling around the drain?"  not entirely on hte wrong track
      - there's a major problem, and we find outselves in the path of needing to
        do something about it.  A guild you will all work for.  options either 
        work for it, or enlisted in session 1.  Can talk about together.       
        Want to design that they're ready to adventure, be assigned to do things and
        go do them.
      - mikey: have physically connected twins as a player character?
        - shannon/mikey twins?  now conjoined twins?
    - 9 sessions not a lot of session to slowly develop nuance in a character and
      progress. What are you playing for, and where you aiming to get.
      - if a place to grow to, I wouldn't waste time.
      - if imaptient to go to patience, don't wait for season 5
    - don't expect all players will be as involved in moving characters forward,
      hard thing to move it through a story arc while improving through several
      story arcs.  Step will move the main story arc along. We don't have to do
      much aside from RP.  If folks just want to play straight all the way 
      through.  Need to be intentional if moving, and make charater moments with
      other players
  - big disaster, specific assignments to unwind the disaster, from there we'll
    uncover an even bigger problem, that you might or might not do anything about
    and then we're done.
  - more idea of progression, be "a new one-shot every week"  "and now you're
    here", and several fun mini-adventures, in wildly different places, in Orub and
    elsewhere in the multiverse. in the beginning, just move through setup assignments
  - any place or idea want to play within. think of favorite movies 
    - settings, scenes, shows.
  - pull up a thing real quick

name of a thinkg I found.  Bibbi Bonkers and the Meat Factory.
Fizzle Blimps in Sugar Land

"are you speaking this into existance"


* 5e rules, keep it flexible.
  - races / classes / non-standard materials is in-pla
  - want to keep it balanced, but more on story side
  - come up with flaws for characters
  - character death?  PvP?
    - going to be lighter / not grimdark, the world isn't trying to kill the characters
      (necessarily)
    - move level fast. won't have time to learn ins and outs. won't level
      monsters as fast.  If get to 14/16ish, don't know how to weave the abilities
      together. (16?  eep)
    - go with sessions unless nobody is showing up. Not expecting everyone will
      make it every saturady, and keep moving. and not waste time explaining.
    - race rules - using more of the ancestry and culture trait.
    - make race on what you want to look like
    - and pick stats on what you want.
    - e.g. add +2 to one thing and +1 to another. So not building in dumb or bad
      assumptions.
    - prescribe to handle some of the non-numerical traits.
    - pick non-physical traits. 
    - shannon has a flying broomstick
    - use things given like candy, assume in a candy factory - get money, spend it.
  - think about what will make this time fun
  - 'stepmarches'
  - hope we get into some situations where Waldowski is super snarky and will just happen
  

  - [X] 4th level?
  - [X] pick feet or ASI - 
  - [ ] roll?  Standard array / point buy?

There is an event going on, at a local town, horse-shire.  A wedding going on.
All invited.  A big wedding.
  - skyfire consulting
  - "our parents case may be re-opening", doing side jobs. "hire the weird twins"
  - "the twins" b/c they like our services.

Basil is a guest
  - do tink about food/msuic (and security) about that side of the event.
  - where we'll be started.  A whole-day celebration. 
  - Claude and Claudine

Asked Realized Basil never picked a magic item or a weapon - thinking
of combining the two - the Marcus Cole Mimbari Fighting Pike -
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnT1sQv1AGk at 1:03 (it's literally a

After Found-the-Temple episode,

bork at different timelines.

* easiest way to think that character at that level.  Like at session #1, before
or after that session, and tell based on situations things you know.

Say ~before~ after the wedding.  Just had this weird experience in another.

All the same timeline for your character as you know him, just has this.

- just knows after the wedding session
- same gear, hitpoints, spells as the level
  - start that in the next session

- probably challenging for character.

- decent chance it'll go down for that battel.
  - if it happens, it'll be a swap-in point for the level 10 character
  - at the point

Arrival of a new level 10 character.
  - Go to green
  - go back to blue.  Right now between green and blue
  - like a level 9 basil, when do that scene, will take you scene a different
    experience, then bring 10 blue basil in to swap out uncionous level 4
  - Blue basil, but will have more knowledge than before.  Seen a little bit more.

want it to be simpl enough that party gets an idea what's going on, and complicated
enough that !necessarily figure out the whole thing.

----------

start session with that
