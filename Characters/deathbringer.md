Some poetry:
```
If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear; 
The sea-blooms and the oozy wounds they wear

As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need. 
I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed! 
```

```
I am a serious fighter
I'm sorry I hit you there so hard
But
You are so weak
why do I care about the likes of you"
```

```
I am a rock
crushed between the walls
of love and pain
shattered by the sound
of the darkness
```

```
I sit alone
awaiting to see
if anyone will come 
and save me.

I've been here for years
and yet no one has come
shattered by the sound
of the darkness
```

```
you dream of life
and the rage inside
you paint these blood-stained walls
just to find yourself
faded out completely
```

```
you took my heart
you made me belive
you made me think
it was meant to be
you made me cry

I fell for it again
but still I won't forget you.
and you will never know
that you broke me
```

```
I am a sea of feelings. I am an emocean
```
