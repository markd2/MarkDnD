looks like:
* skinny, black hair. covers one eye
* flowing black robes, with silver skulls on them, over loose fitting black
  leather armor
* in addition to a backpack, he's got a mace with a silver-looking skull on it on
  one hip. He kind of leans that direction.
* smells faintly of harpy poop.


Some poetry:
```
If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear; 
The sea-blooms and the oozy wounds they wear

X As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need. 
X I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed! 
```

```
X I am a serious fighter
I'm sorry I hit you there so hard
But
You are so weak
why do I care about the likes of you"
```

```
I am a rock
crushed between the walls
of love and pain
X you will be shattered by the sound of the darkness
```

```
I sit alone
awaiting to see
if anyone will come 
and save me.

I've been here for years
and yet no one has come
shattered by the sound
of the darkness
```

```
you dream of life
and the rage inside
you paint these blood-stained walls
just to find yourself
faded out completely
```

```
X you took my heart
X you made me belive
X you made me think
X it was meant to be
X Tamida, you made me cry

I fell for it again
but still I won't forget you.
and you will never know
that you broke me
```

```
I am a sea of feelings. I am an emocean
```

DB: "civilization?"  19 investiaiton.
Look at the sky, up close as walk the line of vegetation, see a not a well
trod (game trail, or some other kind of trail inland.

heading inland, the beach falls away behind.  Traveling inland, hear some 
gentle if distant strint music. Hard to place the exact direction

Insland, some source of actual music.

"vada you feel pretty good about ducking under leaves and vanish", as you
move through the forest, do find where the trail following narrows and narrows but
just before vanishes, comes to a dead stop, with two built-up moss covered
moss walls. Nice looking well-designed wrought iron gate, that has small
blue runes pocking the side.

next to the latch, a place to put mail, a small mailbox shaped hole dug out of the
stone.

observing all this from the nearby foret, not stepped up to the gate.

FYI, weird creepy gate, looks like it has some things taking out with my
dagger like my runes.

hear voice "invitation, please"

"you took my heart"

fwoosh!

"i am a serious fighter"

ard helps.

The ring around the hole fades from blue to yellow to orange, and to green.
and the  blue runes covering the gate vanished.

ard looks at vada - "you owe me"

----------

green path.

vada is "nice, totaly worked", let's get in here.

Gate did not open. Did watch a bunc hof the magic inscriptions go dark
and vanish.

DB open gate.

Beatuiful green garden, with a perfectly placed cross-section cylidner of
stone, footpath in green grass. Nothing like the jungle. Past the gate,
plath leads up to some immaculately cut hedges, split in a couple of
<paths around a large pink salmon-colored mansion. with some pillars outside,
outdoor courtyard, and some well-dressed in foreign  if beautiful suits,
indviduals arm in arm

Nobody noticed us yet.  courtyard, planters, hedgeows

saly - "animals? "just humans"

A few couples outside.  Two standing north. towards platners, some up

A: "tell me more" 
F: I'll tell you later

Ard in front a white marble statue, dwarven warrior of some kind,
recognize the outfit, hide helmet, strips of steel, leather and furs,
large buckler and warhammer, all hewn of a giant block of white
marble, exquisite detail.

ard mumbling "exquisite", not intending to HEY Everybody, but this
is beautfiul, the detail, talking to himself.
others nearby could hear the voice.  EMOTING.  and don't feel like talkign
to anyone else.

SW corner, see two women speaking to each other. One in  cream colored
dress, one in emerald dress.  Red Wine.  Green dress, "hello adventurer,
what brings you to our villa".  I am Lady Elaine.

Ard goes away and LE back to conversation

Vada, see ard wandering around, see him wandering around and inspecting, 
see frederick, see sally and deathbringer walk up those southern stairs

Vada - determined that these people aren't much of a thread of me, and I
carve Vada was here just to honk off Ard.

And ard smacks her in the back of her head.

Sally - "DB let's get out of here"

ard pulls her ear.  Vada reacts "owwww aaard come'on it's just a joooke"
ard just so flustered. No Words, just red steam coming out his ears.

Vada - dex check.  as started writing, get throug Vada was" before Ard
gets up and starts yelling at you.  "Vada Was" - kind of a deep meaning,
then runs up the stairs.

couple on stairs doesn't notice their presence.

speaking to a gentlement in a dark brown suit, flower poking out of the

just floating intruments laying themselves.  some couples. One lady sitting alone
in a chair, but motly folk sin pairs, or pairs in round table.

In the bak of the room, black dres topto bottom is a woman with a glass of
deep red wine, enjoying instruments and looking around the room.

"any pay attention us?"  nope

ard - goes to the lady in the back.  "Grozektsy third concerto, amazing

confident that you've never heard this music before, and you _know_ music.
Very good taste.

ard: splended.  I appreaciate the effort
vada: perception check. (and ard with disadvanage)
     16 / 7
Vada, you beun approaching Kim, and as you begin to skirt the nearest
patron, almost bump in to them, b/c focused on conversation.  and notice
the thinnest, see it and gone, swear you saw a thin thread from the top of the
head up towards the ceiling. When glance, can't see it any more.

kim: some lovely roast cooking, some wine on the tables. Your hospitality
is expansive, and thank you.

ard did not know the music, skeptical, Thing Aint Right.  ard playing
alon gbeing his snooty self. "I shall go mingle with other guests"

"thank you. if you do encounter some of the dlicious meat by teh fire,
do make sure and ... have a bite"  and make a CON save. (15)
"you feel a piercing stabbing pain through your back as if
someone is ctting into your kidney with a scimiatar.  Hot, like a poisoned
blade, feel the poisoin try to grip you. It does not managed to take
ahold . 6hp piercing damage. As you feel through your flank, the end of long
pointy leg of something.  Black, chitonous, lke the tip of a spear, jut gone in
through part of your side and out.  Go some fiberous hairs, and draws back
out.

can I see the origin? "behind you"

Vada, you see as walk forward, see SallyDBFrederick staring into pitch
black darkness. You watch apperating as out of nowhere, what looks a 2-3
section distal end of a spider's end, appears out of nowhere, and stabs up
through companion ard, and draws and begins to disappear.  you watch
as the illusion fades

arcana - 19

Manage to visually track the end of this spider leg as it draws back, watch
as the entire atmosphere doesn't fade, but begins to crumble.  Wallpaper
turns gray. Floor covered with dust. Patrons, they're inhuman.  marionettes,
each with multiple threads running to the ceiling.  Faceless automatitca
of wood, puppets.  The clothing bomces ratty, falling apart, threadbare,
faceless individuals move as they did before. Not seeming to taken notice. And
many tables are collapsed. aged / ancient. Stone is dusty. Instrumetns not
playing, they lie broken and frgottenin the back of the room
