# Session 8 - Give Everyone a Hand

The party, having entered the cell block, found Ingrun Knixhult, a wealthy furniture maker from Hookhill who was ambushed (along with his caravan) traveling through the Dim Forest, thrown into a burlap sack, and presented to Explicitica Defilus, the Reptile God.  Having managed to avoid being "converted", he was thrown into prison with Kari.

BONK, with help from the rest of the party, bent the bars and freed Kari and Ingrun. Kari related her experience being taken in front of the Reptile God (hooded, taken through a smelly place, some kind of loud roaring creature, and a boat ride) before some 1:1 time with, well, you know.

Kari related stories about the chief cleric, Gareth Primo, coming in and questioning the prisoners (questions about their childhoods, math problems, standing on one foot, etc).

The party noticed that they've not seen a lot of folks down here or a lot of activity (like the room with provocative murals was empty), Kari remarked that there's not been a lot of guard action.  They come by at most once a day to bring food and empty the chamberpots. (and the guards are usually pretty dazed anyway).  A long rest brought everyone up to 100% without incident.

The party moved north into The Zombie Factory (26), an room with four pretty horrifying tables upon which Zombies are made (Kari has unfortunately witnessed this happening). Sam investigated the desk in the corner (with Tamida's help) and found his "Zombie Making for Dummies" book (alas all the spells are written in shorthand), and a note

  Garath
  You must reduce the number of resistant slaves.   I'm tired of excuses!  We have a schedule!
  (swooshy "E")

A door to the north beckons.  BONK, readying desk drawer as a weapon opens the door.

Inside, is a small chapel, with three pews, walls covered by wooden panels, and a raised wooden dais with an altar supporting a statue - a snake with a human face. Next to the altar is Gareth Primo, dressed in clerical robes, doing something up there, with an assistant over his shoulder.

There's five crates by the door with shipping labels on them:

    Gareth Primo
    C.R.G.

                Maneer Ecords
                c/o Temple of Merikka
                Room 14

"Oh good, you're here. Wasn't expecting you for a couple of days. Take those boxes up to John Parker before he finishes unloading our new recruits" and turns back to whatever he was working on.

Being the good adventurers they are, the party took all the crates back to the zombie room and looted them. Finding

#1 - sort of heavy.  Has paper, some notebooks, and the Cover letter (below)
#2 - light but bulky. Has turnips
#3 - Ratty pieces of padded armor, some skanky weapons. Smells like goblins
#4 - a box of clean bones. Enough for a couple complete skeletons
#5 - *Heavy* Iron pieces for a torture device, maybe parts for another Iron Maiden

The letter in crate #1:

  Maneer,

  Good Gods have you not figured out why that little wench of yours is immune?  Chompy is getting fat from all our rejects, and She is displeased.

  When She is displeased, I am displeased.

  Neighborly,
  Garath


Kari took some femurs and BONK took a big chunk of iron.

The party schemed and planned, with BONK to (reply hazy) kneecap Gareth Primo and also drive him south to the rest of the party? (I think?).  Gareth's assistant turned out to be a Ghoul (but kind of an ineffective one. Maybe it was a new hire.)  Long story short - knees capped, wrists darted, turnips scattered, Ghoul eliminated, crawling claws summoned, and cleric surrendered.

# Session 9 - Meeting The Chompster

July 14, 2020

Sam and Kari possess slightly different personalities this time through.

The party defeated Gareth Primo, leaving him on the floor with a broken knee and an arrow in the wrist.  BONK playing intimidating presence while Tamida gently interrogated Gareth.  "Tell me of the reptile god"  "how can we find her?"

TL;DR
- Gareth has been working with Explicitca Defilus, the Reptile Gold forabout 2 1/2 - 3 years.  He's not a "convert".  Orlane was the first whole-town takeover. He's really into necromancy.  He doesn't know what Explicitca Defilus actually wants, just that she's collecting harpy poop (and apparently it's a rare / valuable substance), and uses terms like "apotheosis", and plays a hammer dulcimer (even having no hands).  Gareth gets to play with live and dead bodies - plus money. He sketched out a map on how to get to her audience chamber.

Once his usefulness came to an end, BONK attempted to bash his head in, and Kari, finally having one of her tormenters at her mercy, bashes him dead.  Before the final blow landed, he locked eyes with BONK, then Kari, and in one last soliloquy, "Remember this day. I have marked you".  Once dead, a smoky spirit(?) emerged from Gareth Primo, split in two, passed through BONK and Kari, re-formed, and passed up through the ceiling.

Kari double-checked the map, declaring it accurate.  Her first visit to this place was burlap sack over her head as she was led through damp places, through a large smelly room, passing next to a some kind of loud gnashing monster, until put on a boat and taken in front of the Reptile God.

Off into the caves!  Taking the most direct route goes through the muddy cave that Sam first reconnoiter. There's a lot of foot-trafficin the mud going both directions (boots and a kind webbed foot). Also some holes in the mud around the perimeter, and what looks like cross-hatching across the surface. The path was not terribly muddy, with the bulk of the mud shoved towards the walls.  A quick prestidigitation from Tamida after crossing helped clean up people's shoes.

Continuing following the map, into a large (smelly) room with a lot of Troglodytes.  Sam BONK and Kari perfected a swarming technique for taking them down.  Tamida's magic slept one (coup-de-grace by Mui) and HeldPerson another (ditto).

Exiting the now-decimated home of the Froglodytes, the path forks, with horrible sounds coming from the northwest. Kari directs the party up that way because that's the path she went through earlier.  In there they met Chompy™, a giant thundery lizard thing, bound by a neck chain.  Nearby is a rowboat on (yet another) underground lake.

As the camera pulls back, BONK starts feeding Trog bodies to Chompy™ in an attempt to tame it.
