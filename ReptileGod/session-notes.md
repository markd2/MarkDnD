# Session 8 - Give Everyone a Hand

The party, having entered the cell block, found Ingrun Knixhult, a wealthy furniture maker from Hookhill who was ambushed (along with his caravan) traveling through the Dim Forest, thrown into a burlap sack, and presented to Explicitica Defilus, the Reptile God.  Having managed to avoid being "converted", he was thrown into prison with Kari.

BONK, with help from the rest of the party, bent the bars and freed Kari and Ingrun. Kari related her experience being taken in front of the Reptile God (hooded, taken through a smelly place, some kind of loud roaring creature, and a boat ride) before some 1:1 time with, well, you know.

Kari related stories about the chief cleric, Gareth Primo, coming in and questioning the prisoners (questions about their childhoods, math problems, standing on one foot, etc).

The party noticed that they've not seen a lot of folks down here or a lot of activity (like the room with provocative murals was empty), Kari remarked that there's not been a lot of guard action.  They come by at most once a day to bring food and empty the chamberpots. (and the guards are usually pretty dazed anyway).  A long rest brought everyone up to 100% without incident.

The party moved north into The Zombie Factory (26), an room with four pretty horrifying tables upon which Zombies are made (Kari has unfortunately witnessed this happening). Sam investigated the desk in the corner (with Tamida's help) and found his "Zombie Making for Dummies" book (alas all the spells are written in shorthand), and a note

  Garath
  You must reduce the number of resistant slaves.   I'm tired of excuses!  We have a schedule!
  (swooshy "E")

A door to the north beckons.  BONK, readying desk drawer as a weapon opens the door.

Inside, is a small chapel, with three pews, walls covered by wooden panels, and a raised wooden dais with an altar supporting a statue - a snake with a human face. Next to the altar is Gareth Primo, dressed in clerical robes, doing something up there, with an assistant over his shoulder.

There's five crates by the door with shipping labels on them:

    Gareth Primo
    C.R.G.

                Maneer Ecords
                c/o Temple of Merikka
                Room 14

"Oh good, you're here. Wasn't expecting you for a couple of days. Take those boxes up to John Parker before he finishes unloading our new recruits" and turns back to whatever he was working on.

Being the good adventurers they are, the party took all the crates back to the zombie room and looted them. Finding

#1 - sort of heavy.  Has paper, some notebooks, and the Cover letter (below)
#2 - light but bulky. Has turnips
#3 - Ratty pieces of padded armor, some skanky weapons. Smells like goblins
#4 - a box of clean bones. Enough for a couple complete skeletons
#5 - *Heavy* Iron pieces for a torture device, maybe parts for another Iron Maiden

The letter in crate #1:

  Maneer,

  Good Gods have you not figured out why that little wench of yours is immune?  Chompy is getting fat from all our rejects, and She is displeased.

  When She is displeased, I am displeased.

  Neighborly,
  Garath


Kari took some femurs and BONK took a big chunk of iron.

The party schemed and planned, with BONK to (reply hazy) kneecap Gareth Primo and also drive him south to the rest of the party? (I think?).  Gareth's assistant turned out to be a Ghoul (but kind of an ineffective one. Maybe it was a new hire.)  Long story short - knees capped, wrists darted, turnips scattered, Ghoul eliminated, crawling claws summoned, and cleric surrendered.



==================================================
# Session 9 - Meeting The Chompster

July 14, 2020

Sam and Kari possess slightly different personalities this time through.

The party defeated Gareth Primo, leaving him on the floor with a broken knee and an arrow in the wrist.  BONK playing intimidating presence while Tamida gently interrogated Gareth.  "Tell me of the reptile god"  "how can we find her?"

TL;DR
- Gareth has been working with Explicitca Defilus, the Reptile Gold forabout 2 1/2 - 3 years.  He's not a "convert".  Orlane was the first whole-town takeover. He's really into necromancy.  He doesn't know what Explicitca Defilus actually wants, just that she's collecting harpy poop (and apparently it's a rare / valuable substance), and uses terms like "apotheosis", and plays a hammer dulcimer (even having no hands).  Gareth gets to play with live and dead bodies - plus money. He sketched out a map on how to get to her audience chamber.

Once his usefulness came to an end, BONK attempted to bash his head in, and Kari, finally having one of her tormenters at her mercy, bashes him dead.  Before the final blow landed, he locked eyes with BONK, then Kari, and in one last soliloquy, "Remember this day. I have marked you".  Once dead, a smoky spirit(?) emerged from Gareth Primo, split in two, passed through BONK and Kari, re-formed, and passed up through the ceiling.

Kari double-checked the map, declaring it accurate.  Her first visit to this place was burlap sack over her head as she was led through damp places, through a large smelly room, passing next to a some kind of loud gnashing monster, until put on a boat and taken in front of the Reptile God.

Off into the caves!  Taking the most direct route goes through the muddy cave that Sam first reconnoiter. There's a lot of foot-trafficin the mud going both directions (boots and a kind webbed foot). Also some holes in the mud around the perimeter, and what looks like cross-hatching across the surface. The path was not terribly muddy, with the bulk of the mud shoved towards the walls.  A quick prestidigitation from Tamida after crossing helped clean up people's shoes.

Continuing following the map, into a large (smelly) room with a lot of Troglodytes.  Sam BONK and Kari perfected a swarming technique for taking them down.  Tamida's magic slept one (coup-de-grace by Mui) and HeldPerson another (ditto).

Exiting the now-decimated home of the Froglodytes, the path forks, with horrible sounds coming from the northwest. Kari directs the party up that way because that's the path she went through earlier.  In there they met Chompy™, a giant thundery lizard thing, bound by a neck chain.  Nearby is a rowboat on (yet another) underground lake.

As the camera pulls back, BONK starts feeding Trog bodies to Chompy™ in an attempt to tame it.

==================================================
# Session 10 - We Are The Chompians

BONK fed some troglodytes to Chompy.  Sam cast Speak With Animals, and had a  nice chat with Lord Peter Chompsy.  Quite erudite when communicating with Sam.  Through an offering of more troglodytes, along with using Gareth Primo's key ring, released Chompy from his neck collar and chain.  The party floated the idea of Chompy using his tail to fling BONK at their target.  A bit of practice, and BONK's sea-legs, showed that it was a tenable strategy.

Outside of Chompy's lair, the party found a boat and large indoor lake, which our new friend could easily ford.  Finding themselves on a large beach, they met Expliciitica Defilus, the Reptile God - playing a five-hammer dulcimer, via Mage Hand because she has no arms.  Large human face on an even larger snake body.

After a bit of cheerful banter, Chompy flung BONK at Explicitica Defilus, where she immediately produced a small(ish) movable magical barrier, bouncing BONK off of it. An attempt at mind-bending Klar did not work.

Epic Battle ensued.  Chompy taking a bite ~out of crime~ the shield!  Raging! Lightneninining!  More Lightening!  Sandworming! Flurries of Blows! 

Chompy was also instructed to harass the Reptile God. After a particular good tail-chomp (Lord Peter does earn the name), she unloaded a brutal chained lightning  attack on those who seemed to be controlling, or at least influencing, their pet T-Rex. They both drop!  Tamida hands off the Globe of Invulnerability scroll (they got from Ramne) to Mui. Kari leaps up on The Reptile God's Back!

BONK and Sam are dead.  Or so it seems.

A glowing oval appears before Sam.  Two small green hands reach out and pull him in.  A little slowly at first, then a disturbingly fast _schlorp_.  It disappears.

Seconds later, the glowing oval appears before BONK.  Again, two small green hands reach out and pull him in.  Slowly at first, then even more disturbingly fast (given BONK's size) is _schlorped_ away.  The oval disappears.

Camera pans back, showing a dark ... room?  Sam and BONK lying on the ground.  The space is illuminated by one wall.  A small green goblin with mottled skin is fussing over Sam's wounds. "Dammit Figboot is gonna hand me my ass if he finds out." An older gentleman beside him says "Don't tell him. What he doesn't know can't hurt him. This one is important" as he nods to BONK.

As Sam has all his HP restored, he looks up at the green face of Boz'Lee, Figboot's assistant.  Next to him is Ramne, the wizard from Orlane.  Sam sees Ramne put a hand on his chest, a flow of energy, replenishing his spent magic stores.

They proceed to patch up BONK as well.  Looking out the "window", Sam sees a frozen tableau - a wounded Explicitica Defilus being harried by a gigantic thunderlizard.  Kari in mid-leap.  Tamida handing off a scroll relay-race style to Mui.  But it's not really frozen.  Kari is actually slowly arcing.  Mui finishes grasping the scroll.  Sam sees power lines moving (slowly) around everyone.  Some are curved and swirly, like around the Reptile God, Klar, Mui.  Some are absolutely straight, surrounding Kari, Tamida,  Laeryn.

BONK stands up.  Boz'Lee shouts "dammit go out there and finish her off", planting a (small) foot in the middle Sam's back and giving a shove.

BONK and Sam reappear on the beach.  Magic is cast, attacks are made.  Laeryn, dodging through the chaotic melee, finds a weakness, and decapitates  ~Shia LaBeouf~ The Reptile God.  She falls to the ground, bleeding over the sand. 

Klär expertly removes the skin, giving it to Tamida.  Over the course of the day, a new pair of Spirit Naga clogs, a stylish apron (of unstainability), and a Chompy-Sized vest (of lightning resistance) are made.

The camera pans out, showing the upper levels of the swamp-lair, with the cultists on the floor or slumped against the wall, looking dazed and confused.  Days pass getting to Orlane.  We see Aelric crying and saying "I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry" over and over to Kari, as Tamida leans in to offer support. Ramne is helping folks out. The Golden Grain Inn has been burned to the ground and John Parker, purveyor of "recruits", hanged from a tree.  Misha Devi in the Temple of Merrika is cleaning up the blasphemy, attempting to beginning to atone for her participation in the entire Unpleasantness.  Bilba Cralloon has turned the Sleeping Serpent Inn into a makeshift psych ward to help the people of Orlane recover.
