# 21. Secret Treasure Room

The secret door is made of canvas over a wooden frame, painted to blend into the
early of the chamber walls.  It is not locked.

The room beyond has a low 5' ceiling, the dingy chamber has three chests in
it that are used to store the donations to the cult when they fill the chest
in Bertram's bedroom.  Since the entire hoard was moved to the temple and then
to the Dungeon a month ago, all threechests are open and empty.
