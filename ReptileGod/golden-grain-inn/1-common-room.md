# 1. Common Room

Room seems like a pleasant place, but the people are subdued, generally
sitting alone.  Those sitting together are not talking and no fires are
lit in the fireplace.

Cult member!

3d4 customers sit quietly about the large common room, sipping from mugs.

80% chance the assasin **Derek Desleigh* will be present.  (personal description
in room 6)

**Derek Desleigh** greets strangers cheerfully and offer a drink of beer, wine, or
brandy. (instructions from the cult tell him so)

Food and rooms are available.  Beswill will attempt to learn why the party is in
Orlane, and if suspicions are aroused, he will try to persuade them to stay
in his inn for the night.

If he feels they are a thread to the cult, he may even offer a reduced rate in order
to arrange an ambush.  May also offer free drinks that have been drugged by
his cook.  (room 2)

Food and drink are availale here, but the quality is poor and the prices
"nothing short of outrageous"

e.g. beer pint 1sp,  beer pint dark 2sp. wine, pint, watery white 2spm, watery red 2sp
wine, orlane special, pint 1gp
