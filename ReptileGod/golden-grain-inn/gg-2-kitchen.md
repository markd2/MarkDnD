2. Kitchen

Box text:

This room is obviously a kitchen. Jars of beans, bread, flour, and dried meat
can be seen stored in several open cupboards. A short, rat-faced man is busily
wiping off a none-too-clean table.

This is **Snigrot Dogroot** (assassin 3).  Keeps a dagger+1 in his boot.
Snigrot will be rude and short-tempered toward any strangers in his kitchen.
There is nothing of special value or interest here.

He's the master of drugged drinks. They have a delay of 2-12 turns, after which
the victim must make a save vs poison. If save, person will feel groggy and know
something is wrong. (-2 on to hit rolls)  If the save failed, rendered
unconcious for 5-10 (1d6+4) hours.  If some are captured, see the notes
on cult activities

If the drinks are drugged, Beswill will attempt to disarm party suspicans until
at least half the party is affected. he will then call for the five cult members in 
room 11 (Cult Member's Room) 

Particular attention will be paid to magic users (he knows about sleep spells)
The cult members in the common room will not generally press the attack unless led
by the main NPCs (Beswill, Snigrot, and Derek)

The party's best response is immediate flight, cult members will not pursue outside
the in itself.  Beswill will not order the capture until he is nearly certain of
its success at minimal risk to himself.
