# 22. Large Dirt Chamber

Box text:

This room appears empty, and is noteworthy only for the fact that the timbers
at the far end have collapsed, leaving a pile of loose earth against the wall.

If they distrub the dirt they will awaken the MUDVIPER (giant poisonous snake)

b/c of the chilly temperature in teh chamber, snakes movement and # of attacksare
cut in half, -2 to hit.
