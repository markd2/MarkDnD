6. Large Guest Room

box text:

This room contains a bed, a storage chest, a table, and four chairs.
A rough rug covers the center of the floor

This is the chamber of **Derek Desleigh**.  Only a 20% chance he will be here
during the inn's normal hours.  Otherwise will be in the common room.

Wears a shortsword and wears leather armor +1.  A long scar runs down the
right side of his face, making his appearance bizarre and frightening.

Certainly the meanest person n Orlane. "considers a murder rushed if less than
three hours elapse between the first wound and the coup de grace"

Uses a slim dagger for this work, carrying in a sheath at the nape of his neck.

Derek is the only person to mask the fact he was not charmed. Masquerading as
a cult member, but his first priority is himself.  He follows the orders
of the innkeeper in abdcting persons from rooms 7-10, but has been
siphoning off many of the funds gathered by the cult.  If his cover becomes
shaky, he will leave town.

Has a locked iron strongbox under his bed, and always keeps the key on a string
around his neck. A poison needle trap in the lock could bring an abrupt end to
the unwary who tries to pick the lock wo removingthe trap.

Three bottles are wrapped in a lush velvet cloth, each containing a clear
liquid.  Poison potion (save at +4 if a sip is taken), potion of healing,
and a potion of gaseous form.
