# 24. Statue of the naga.

The human face of this statue is the first thing seen by characters entering
the chamber.  This extremely authentic carving has been created out of several
tusks of ivory, skillfully blended by a master craftsman and raised on a stone
dias.

Worth 5000gp, but equivalent to weight to 8000 gp, so moving it will be difficult.

May be broken into smaller parts to be moved, but each break will detract
1000 gp from the total value.  15% cumulative chance that each break will cause
the statue to shatter into worhtless scraps. (prior pieces still worth 1000 gp)
