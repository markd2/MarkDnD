# 19. Underground passages

Box text:

The corridor beyond the southeast door has been hastily excavated from the dirt,
and is shored at 5-foot intervals with heavy timbers on the walls and ceiling.
The ceiling is only 6' high. The floor is smooth dirt, and there is an odor of
must and decay here. The air is unusuay cold. Many rats scurry for cover as the
door is opened.

(rats are harmless)
