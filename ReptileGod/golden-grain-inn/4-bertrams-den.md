# 4. Bertram's Den

Box text:

Four large and comfortable chairs face a huge fireplace in the east wall,
while a bare wooden table has four hard chairs placed around it.
Crates of plates and mugs are stacked in the south-east corner.

If Bertram is in the bedroom, the door will be locked, otherwise it stands open.
