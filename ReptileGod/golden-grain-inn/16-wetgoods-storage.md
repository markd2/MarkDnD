# 16. Wetgoods Storage

box text:

A dozen kegs and casks of varous sizes are kept here.  The room has
a dirt floor and the air here is damp and chilled.


Two small casks contain red and white wine, while the rest contain
different types of beer.  The outside cellar door is
locked and barred from the inside.  Nothing else of interest here.
