# 18. Secret Meeting Room

The catch of the secret door is released by pulling down on a torch socket in room
15. The room beyond contains a table, several benches, and a ladder rising to a trapdoor
in the ceiling (to Beswill's room 5)

In the southeast corner is a stout wooden door with a bar across this side holding
it firmly shut.  

Otherwise empty
