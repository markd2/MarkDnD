# 15. Main Cellar Room

The stairway from the kitchen ends in this dark and musty room with no
windows. Many tables and chairs, some broken, stacked in the south wall.
Cobwebs cover much of the ceiling, filling the space between the rafters.

Two unlocked wooden doors flank the stairway, and the walls have many
torch sockets arranged along them at neat intervals. 

One opens the secret door to room 18
