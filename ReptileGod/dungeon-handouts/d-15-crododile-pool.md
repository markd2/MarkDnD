# 15. Crocodile Pool  and hidden boat

This large room has no doors.  The cooridors leading to it
simpy end at the water's edge. While very shallow around its 
perimeter, the bool reaches a depth of 4' in the center.
The muck on the bottom will reduce movement to 1/4 normal speed.

2 or 3 crocodiles

A stagnant, musty smell is strong here. The water is relatively clear
and many small fish can be seen.  The more noteworthy residents
of the chamber are resting on a mud shelf at the northeast end of
the room.

Any ripple in the water will cause them to enter the pool and
swim toward the source of the movement.

Note: the crocodiles will not use their second attack unless
the victim is out of the water.

No treasure.

15a. Hidden Boat

This small alcove hides a small boar the cult members use to cross
the crocodile pool. This boat holds up to 10 characters, and
the crocdiles will not attack it unless disturbed,
