# 24. Chamber of the Dead

The door to this room is swollen with moisture (-1 to open).

There is a thick column in the center of the room and smell of death
permeates the air.

Behind the pillar stands a _Coffer Corpse_, can only be damaged by
magic weapons)

The creature will step into view as the characters enter the room.
It resembles a zombie, but is treated as a wrath.

It will advance on the party, claw-like hands outstretched.

Normal weapons will seem to do damage, and if it takes >6 hp damage
in a single round, it will fall to the ground.  It will rise to its
feet on the following round, and characters seing it must save vs
spells or flee in panic for 2-8 rounds (2d4).

When the coffer corpse scores a hit, this indicates it has locked
its hands around the victim's throat.

Will inflict 1d6 points of damage to its victim until one or the
other is dead.

No treasure.

Door to the north is locked and must be picked or forced.
