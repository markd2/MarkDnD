# 1. Wooden Stairs

The muddy wooden stairs are slippery.

Characters who do not take special precautions (roping, etc) must roll

their dexterity or less on a d20  - save  DC 15

or slip and tumble to the bottom.

Characters who fall will knock any characters in front of them down as well.

No damage taken in the fall.
