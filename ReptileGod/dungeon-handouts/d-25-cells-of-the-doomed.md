# 25. Cells of the Doomed

The door leading to the five cells is locked.  Aparty entering here
will find three cells unoccupied.  The other two contain prisoners
who have succeeded in saving vs the naga's charm.

They have been penned up here waiting for whatever unthinkable fate is
in store for them.

The first cell contains the son and daughter of Orlane's carpenter.

The second holds a prosperous merchange from Hookhill, taken with his
ill-fated caravan in the Dim Forest,

MEET KAROSHA / Kari HERE!

The prisoners will be extremely grateful to be rescued and will tell
all they know of the naga's chamber (room 37).  Will not fight, and
none has seen the secret passage between 27 and 37.
