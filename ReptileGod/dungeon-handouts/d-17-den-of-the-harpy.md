# 17. Den of the Harpy

https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/harpy

The southern chamber can barely be seen from the north end of the
corridor.  A thief could reach it, avoiding the mud, by making two
_climb sheer surface_ rolls and moving laterally along the walls.

One of the 20' timbers from room 9 could be brought and used as a bridge,
but would require a strength combined of 40 to lift, and could
only be carried through the dungeon at a fully encumbered movement rate.

The chamber is much like chamber 16, except for the four columns in
the southern chamber have been connected to each other with
branch-like perches, 5-10' off the floor.  

Like Canary Perches.

The harpy has collected
jewlry and medallions as her prizes. And these are draped decoratively
from her perches.

Jewelry is worth 250gp.  100gp x2, 90pgp, 75gp, and 50gp.
A ruby medallion writh 800gp, and a _necklace of adaptation_ which loks
like a 50gp necklace.  A hole in the ceiling, unreachable by climbing,
leads to an exit through a hummock in the marsh.
