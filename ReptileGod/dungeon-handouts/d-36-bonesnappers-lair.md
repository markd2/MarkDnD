# 36. Bonesnapper's Lair

Box text:

This small chamber holds a savage-looking reptile that strongly
resembles a miniature tyrannosaurus rex.  It is chained to the north
wall of the cave and looks as if it can not come closer than 5' to the 
south wall.  Several disturbingy human bones are scattered about, and four
jaw bones have been driven into the dirt walls of the chamber.


This is a Bonesnapper, named CHOMPY.  its jaws can deliver a viscious
bit. The creature's second attack comes from its tail, which can lash
around to strike a creature in front of it.  The chain does prevent it
from approaching closer than 5' from the south wall.

Its main purpose is to snarl, growl, bellow, and otherwise create
noise as creatures pass it, thus warning the naga tht something
approaches.  it will not hesitate to attack and attempt to snack
on any creatures foolish enough to step within reach of its chain
