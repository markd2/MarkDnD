# 27. Alter of Evil

The door to this room is unlocked. Garath Primo is aware of the defeat
of this coffer corpse and is expecting visitors

Box text:

This is a long room whose walls are covered by wooden panels.
At the far end is a raised wooden dais with an altar supporting a statue
of the reptile god - a snake with a human head (face).
Next to the altar is a man dressed in clerical robes who seems to be
expecting you.  The shadowy human form of what might be his
assistant can be seen skulking behind the statue of the reptile god.

He wears chain mail and carries a sheidl and a wicked hammer with a head
like that of a snake.

He has a ring of keys n his belt which contains the keys for all the
doors in 24 and 25, as well as the chests in rooms 4 and 23

His spells:
* 1: cure light wounds (x2), detect magic, darkness, detect good
* 2: chant, hold person, know alignment, resist fire, snake charm
* 3: animate dead.

After the party enters the room, Garath's sinister assistant will
reveal itself to be a wight.  Garath will allo the wight to attack
first, while he casts spells into the melee, using the hold first.

The naga statue is carved from stone, while the altar is made of wood.
Rotating the head of the tatue in either direction will cause a wooden
panel in the north wall to drop through the floor, revealing a secret 
passage.

The door is indetectable by normal seraching until the statue's head
is moved.
