# 27. Alter of Evil

The door to this room is unlocked. Garath Primo is aware of the defeat
of this coffer corpse and is expecting visitors

Box text:

This is a long room whose walls are covered by wooden panels.
At the far end is a raised wooden dais with an altar supporting a statue
of the reptile god - a snake with a human head (face).
Next to the altar is a man dressed in clerical robes who seems to be
hovering over the altar with his back to you.
The shadowy human form of what might be his
assistant can be seen skulking next to him

Hearing the door open, he glances over his shoulder without recognition.

"oh good, you're here. Take those boxes up to John Parker before he finishes
unloading the new recruits"

and then he goes back to what he's doing.

There's five crates, about two to three foot cubes, with mailing labels
(HANDOUT if someone looks).  One is really heavy (for BONK), the rest are
bulky but liftable.

Contents:

Boxes:
  #1 - sort of heavy.  Has paper, some notebooks, and the Cover letter (below)
  #2 - light but bulky. Has turnips
  #3 - Ratty pieces of padded armor, some skany weapons. Smells like goblins
  #4 - a box of clean bones
  #5 - *Heavy* Iron pieces for a torture device, maybe parts for another Iron Maiden


In box # 1

  Maneer,

  Good Gods have you not figured out why that little wench of yours
  is immune?  Chompy is getting fat from all our rejects, and She
  is displeased.

  When She is displeased, I am displeased.

  Neighborly,
  Garath

----------



He wears chain mail and carries a sheild and a wicked hammer with a head
like that of a snake.

He has a ring of keys n his belt which contains the keys for all the
doors in 24 and 25, as well as the chests in rooms 4 and 23

His spells:
* 1: cure light wounds (x2), detect magic, darkness, detect good
* 2: chant, hold person, know alignment, resist fire, snake charm
* 3: animate dead.

After the party enters the room, Garath's sinister assistant will
reveal itself to be a wight.  Garath will allo the wight to attack
first, while he casts spells into the melee, using the hold first.

The naga statue is carved from stone, while the altar is made of wood.
Rotating the head of the tatue in either direction will cause a wooden
panel in the north wall to drop through the floor, revealing a secret 
passage.

The door is indetectable by normal seraching until the statue's head
is moved.

----------

DC 17 Perception for the statue secret mechanism.

----------

In addition to the ghoul, Garteh can summon a swarm of Crawling Claws.

WHO WHAT WHEN WHERE HOW WHY

----------

Been going on for year and a half or so

---

Expicitica Defilus

WHO - the Reptile God
WHAT = Spirit Naga (AD&D style)
WHEN - She started planning 3 years ago. First conversion 2 years ago.
WHERE - This dungeon was started 3 years ago.
HOW - Originally slinked around converting folks until there was enough converts
     (specifically John Parker and the Golden Grain Inn - quite efficient)
WHY - Collecting bodies and souls for an eventually demonic ritual / summoning
      / apotheosis / layer of the Abyss

Individuals first. Oralane was the first entire town converted. Mistakes were made,
lessons learned.

Hochoch and Hookhill are in-progress.  Nextia has a sleeper agent (!)


---
Gareth - not converted

WHO - Cleric / Nercomancer
WHAT - Right-hand of the Reptile God
WHEN - One of the first Employees of the Reptile God. Say about 2 1/2 years ago
WHERE - Helped design this part of the dungeon (hence the secret connection to the lair)
HOW - Resisted a conversion. Convinced E.D. to hire him on as an assistant
WHY - Dude digs necromancy.  He's proud of the zombies in the water-draining wheel.
      Doesn't actually belive the apotheosis is possible, but is along for the
      money and power

Originally from Orlane, why that was the first full town conversion attempt.
Gareth doesn't like Orlane.

---
Maneer

WHO - Priest / Cleric
WHAT - head priest of the temple of Merrika, then researcher on why conversions failed
WHEN - An early conversion, that kind of went wrong (why he was such a weirdo)
WHERE - Orlane. He grew up in the temple
HOW - 
WHY - Since conversion, he's been assigned the task of figuring (with Gareth) out why
      some folks convert, and some don't.  He's been unable to do that.  This also
      contributed to his genera insanity


---
Misha Devi - Priest / Cleric / Monk

WHO - junior priest of the temple of Merrika.  Head of the small cabal of Monks there
WHEN - a couple of months after Maneers - so she's not as screwed up as he was.
WHERE - Orlane.  Recent-ish (like 5 years ago) transfer from Hochoch. (hence why
        that was the second town converted)
HOW - Noticed Maneer getting weirder and weirder. Noticing some folks disappearing
      or getting weird.
WHY - Since conversion, she's been putting of a facade of being a Merrika temple,
      even though it was a clearing house of stolen treasures

----------

Chompy - Let's just call him our garbage disposal.

Screetchy - the Harpy.  "She's been needing hundreds of pounds of harpy poop.
Do you have any idea how expensive that stuff is?  Been cheaper to just keep one
and feed it the occasional... volunteer"


----------

"Hello Neighbor"

Oh gods I hated Belba Cralloon, and her fake Sacchrine Hello Neighbor. I figured it'd
be hilarious having our verbal handshake.  Maybe cast some doubt on the oh-so-perfect
Belba. <spits>
