# 35. Mudviper Hatchery

Box text:

This room contains several thousand poisonous snake eggs, and a quite
a few of these have broken to reveal their squiggly contents.


The little sankes are easy to kill, but every bit as venemous as their
grown relatives.

Carless characters may undergo normal mudviper attacks (poison only)
at the DM's discretion.

Both these and trog eggs will die if the dungeon is flooded.
