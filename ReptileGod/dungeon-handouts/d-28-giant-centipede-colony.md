# 28. Giant Centipede Colony

Box Text:

This open area is choked with mud.

The mud slows movement by half. Nine centipedes (2hp) dwell
along the perimeter of this room. They will rush to attack any
creature who enters the room from either end.  There is no
treasure here.


----------

lots of foot prints and whatnot.
