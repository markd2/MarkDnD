# 6. Burial Pool

The door, swollen from dampness, is opened at a penalty of -1

Box text:

THe pool here has been the final resting spot for many a skeleton,
after the slimy cretures of the lower level have picked it clean.
Two mossy columns support a low ceiling. The floor is entirely covered
with clear water, sloping to a depth of 6' in the center.
Dozens of skeletons are visible, and a strong smell of death and decay is
in the air.

Nothing of value here.
