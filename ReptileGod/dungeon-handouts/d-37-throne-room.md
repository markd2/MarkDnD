# 37. Throne Room of Explicitica Defilus

This huge cavern is lit by a ghotsly green glow emanating from the 
8 columns supporting the vaulted ceiling.  A rather large flatbottomed
boat is set at the shore of the pool befor you, and the water seems
to occupy most of the cavern.


The boat can carry 10 persons, and has a long pole inside which can
be used to prople it.

If have Ramne, will cast his globe of invulnerability, and caution his
comrades to stay close to him (but not tell them why). he will tell them
about the naga's charm ability and what he can do to counter it
(dispel), and ask the party to tell him when to cast it.  As he will
be avoiding the naga's gaze as long as possible.

Explicitica Defilus arrogantly awaits the party in her alcove.  
The spirit naga ha proclaimed herself "reptile god", coiled atop a collection
of her favorite treasures, as well as the skulls of her most hated
enemies.

PLAYING A HAMMER DULCIMER, with mage hand of course since SHE HAS NO ARMS.


In addition to the permanent charm cast on any creature meeting her
evil gaze, she can use the following and magic-user and clerical spells.

MU 1: detect magic, sleep, shield, ventriloquism
   2: ESP, web
   3: FIREBALL

Cleric 1: detect good, darkness
       2: known alignment

When the party is nearing shore, she will through the fireball first.
as the party is protected by the globe, this is a flashy effect only.
As this is unsuccessful, she will cast her shield.

Realizing her magic is useless, she will await the party on shore.

If ramne ha his lightning bolt he will use it now.  She may use
her darkness defensively, while Ramne may counter with Light

Enraged at the boldness of the party, She will try to destroy them in
melee after they debark (takes a full round).  Ramne will stay in the boat
avoiding her gaze and waiting to throw his dispel magic if too many party
members are charmed.

In addition to her normal attack, she will meet the eys of one party
member each round unless the character is avoiding her gaze (and taking
a -4 (disadvantage?). The victim must make a save vs spell (?) 

She is too arrogant to give charmed characters any orders (plans for
them later). REmember that the naga's bite is poisonous and that when
Ramne casts the dispel, all the potions must save vs being destroyed.

One way to eliminate the gaze is cast a light or continual light
on the naga's eyes.  If the naga misses the save, she will be blinded,
unable to use her gaze and attacking at a -4 to-hit.

DM should use this only if ramn is in immediate and extreme personal
danger. The ace in the hole.

Give the players every opportunity to come up with this one
themselves, and don't use it if they don't need it.

If things are going really badly, some trogs come in - depending on how the
characters entered the lair, they come from the other way (so if players came
in from boat, they'd come in from the secret passage, and vice versa.)


For stronger parties, the DM should adjust the above sequence for
balance - maybe the lightning bolt or dispel has been used, or
she will order charmed characters to fight.  Or maybe a few more crocodiles
or mudvipers around...

The precious possessions she has collected can be seen as a pile of
yellow and slivery coins, some bottles and leather items partially
buried in the pile.

110 pp, 890 gp, 1302 sp, 400gp jeweledbracelet, ruby ring worth 800gp

bag of holding (500 gp capactiy), pair of elven boots, horn of bubbles,
ring of protection =1, ring of ree actions, and six potions in
separate bottles.  Gaseous form, invisiblity, clarivoyance,
philter of love, and two healing.

Two ivory scroll tubes of brilliant white are also buried in the treasure
pile.  Each is sealed and elaborately carved with leafy patterns.

These carvings must be arranged in a pre-designed pattern to release the 
catch.  if the tubes are broken, the scrolls will explode,
doing 1-8 points of damage to anyone withon 10'.  Each scroll tube is worth
400 gp.

Each tube contains a scroll.

First for MU as three spells (slow, stinking cloud, detect magic at
level 7).
Other has three clerical spells (heal, cure disease, and dispel
magic at L11)

Ramne will take the ring of free action and a potion as his share
of magic. Not interested in wealth.

The DM may have Ramne take more or to limit amount of magic.

If the naga is killed, all creatures who have been charmed by her will
be freed from the enchantment.

They will have vague dreamlike memories of their cult activities, but
not remember the experience as being real. (NAH.  MAKE THEM GUILTY,
ESPECIALLY $HUSBAND)

Trogs were not charmed, and still consider humans as mortal
enemies.
