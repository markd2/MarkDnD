# 30. Mud Trap

Box text:

This dank and dingy chamber contains a small chest upon a raised wooden
platform.


<NICE THIS DOWN A BIT>

The chest is bolted firmly to the platform and may not be
moved. It appears to be locekd, but any attempt to pick the lock will
cause it to open.

A successful attempt to _find traps_ by a thief, or _detect unsafe
walls/ceiling_ by a gnome will reveal the trap.

When the chest, which is empty except for the trap mechanism, is opened,
all the ceiling supports in the room will be relsased and a mass of
mud will fall into the chamber from above.

Characters in the room must make a dx save, or be struck by a timber
for 1d6 damage.  Those struck dex save again, failing are trapped
under the bem and will suffocate unless rescued.

Characters that are not trapped under the timbers, regardless of
struck or not, have a 100% chance of escaping the room if they
do so immediately. Trying to rescue trapped friends should be told
that their chances for escape will go down the longer they
remain in the chaimber.

Each character can make one attempt at rescue per round by rolling
a d20. I the result is <= strength, they have rescued a comrade.

There is no actual reduction in the chances to escape for the first
two rounds.

But starting with the third round, the chances go down 10% per round.
