# 30. Mud Trap

Box text:

This dank and dingy chamber contains a small chest upon a raised wooden
platform.

MAYBE A SKILL CHALLENGE

* everyone gets to participate.
* successes vs failures
* 3 failures - group fails.  If fail, make athletics/dex check
* how many successes - 3 is simple.  6 is difficult
* The party has to accumulate a number of succeses
* make skill checks
* let them know you're in a skill challenge and how many successes and failures
* in a mini-game, and what the conditions are
* two or three skills will work - gives them an idea of how are we going to out of here.
  like survival to find the way out.  insight for shortcut and investigation for secret
* crazy things for successes. "DC for survival is 13" got one success. If was 18+,
  two successes, got a shortcut.
* or say nature?  "describe how she would use nature" - get the players thinking
  creativty - roleplaying their skills.  say for air currents are flowing.
* have to be trained in a skill - only if proficient. Avoid character who should not
  do something, get a 20.  important to protect those who are good at something from
  random rolls - make proficiences more meaninging
* once you make an attempt with a skill, you can't do it again.  Need to limit
* describe how their skills earn their success.  (has a pre-made list)
* write consequences of failure.  failing one test.  Or failing all.
* undo failures - acrobatcis, like giant block falling, and acrobatics to escape getting
  crushed. undo it or mitigating
* another character can percept and move someone out of the block's way.
* really dynamic.
* skill challenge to stop ritual - 8 successes before 3 failures. Arcana and religion.
  portail as draining the life essence draining life essence. Can we fight it with
  healing energy.  "medicine check to burn a hit die".  3 failures - death knight

Somewhat deliberatily nebulous.  Capture a dramatic action sequence.
" tell you what skills will be useful", then inventive ways to use them.
need to be proficient. Once attempt a skill, that player can't do the same skill


<NICE THIS DOWN A BIT>

The chest is bolted firmly to the platform and may not be
moved. It appears to be locekd, but any attempt to pick the lock will
cause it to open.

A successful attempt to _find traps_ by a thief, or _detect unsafe
walls/ceiling_ by a gnome will reveal the trap.

When the chest, which is empty except for the trap mechanism, is opened,
all the ceiling supports in the room will be relsased and a mass of
mud will fall into the chamber from above.

Characters in the room must make a dx save, or be struck by a timber
for 1d6 damage.  Those struck dex save again, failing are trapped
under the bem and will suffocate unless rescued.

Characters that are not trapped under the timbers, regardless of
struck or not, have a 100% chance of escaping the room if they
do so immediately. Trying to rescue trapped friends should be told
that their chances for escape will go down the longer they
remain in the chaimber.

Each character can make one attempt at rescue per round by rolling
a d20. I the result is <= strength, they have rescued a comrade.

There is no actual reduction in the chances to escape for the first
two rounds.

But starting with the third round, the chances go down 10% per round.
