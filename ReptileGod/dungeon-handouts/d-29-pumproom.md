Box text:

The passageway slands downward - small rivulets of water trickle
into the darkness. Creaking at splashing noises can be heard
from further along the passage.


This is the lowest room in teh dungeon.  The water that seeps and 
trickles through the labyrinth finally collects in a muddy pool.

Five zombies (always strike last in a round operate a system of
buckets connected to a stout rope and pulley.  As the pull turns
the buckets are dipped into the pool and filled, then
lifted through a hole in the ceiling.

Another pulley is concealed in a hummock in the marsh. At the top
of the cycle, the buckets are tipped, emptying the water into the marsh
and returning for another load.

The zombies are very singleminded of purpose, and will
not react to persons entering the room. If one of them is 
attacked, all will stop working the pulley and defend themselves.
