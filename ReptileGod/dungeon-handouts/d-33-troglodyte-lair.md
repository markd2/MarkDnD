# 33. Troglodyte Lair

A party coming from the south will smell a foul stench from this
cavern well before they enter it.  

A party from the east will begin to smell it as they pas the northern
corridor to 30

Both the south and east corridors are guarded by a male troglody.

As the party approaches, the trogs will retreat to the southern leg
of the lair and blend into the walls, where they will be joined by
5 females. They will viscously defend their eggs and the viper
eggs in 34 and 35.

All 7 adults will be camouflaged, surprising the party on a 1-4

To start the attack, one of the males will hurl a frail wicker
cage at the party (AC 10). If a hit is scored, the cage breaks
against a member of the party, releasing a throroughly enraged
mudviper. which attacks the same round.

The trogs will charge, giving the snake a wide berth until it is dead.
This attack and can be dangerous to a low-level aprty b/c attacks
coming from many directions.

The trogs will not pursue fleeing characters.

The major treasure store of the trogs is in a few leather sacks
buried in the loose dirth at the NW corner of the area.

The excavation may be detected as if a secret door.  The sacks
contain 47 pp, 273 gp, 490 sp and 4 gems worth 350 gp, 200 gp, 110 gp
80 gp
