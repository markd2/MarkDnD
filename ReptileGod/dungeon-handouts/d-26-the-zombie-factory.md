# 26. The Zombie Factory

The room is bare, except for five wooden benches about 3' off the
floor.

Here, GARATH PRIMO, the naga's evil cleric, performs sinister spells,
animating zombies from the bodies of dead humans.

There are neither corpses nor zombies in the room now. (uh...)


Carrie has been in here and has witnessed zombification.

The tables are clean (no puddles of blood).  A desk in the NE corner.

The desk has papers, and a couple of books.

The books are Garath's notebooks. instructions for making zombies, some listing
of spells to that effect (unfortunately it's in a shorthand you don't
understand).

Including a note:


  Garath
  
  You must reduce the number of resistant slaves.
  I'm tired of excuses!  We have a schedule!
