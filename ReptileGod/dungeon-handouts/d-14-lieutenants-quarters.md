Rooms:

14a. This room contains four soft chairs and several
  small tables.  A fire is burning in the large fireplace and a large
  stack of wood is next to it. A keg of Orlanean wine (about 1/4 full)
  is set in the corner, and two glasses are on one of the tables

14b. Benn Griff and Blayze Gobar share this room.  Contains two beds and
  matreses, two chairs, and six wall pegs. Two wollen cloaks are in here,
  but the room is otherwise empty.

14c. This is Jarvis Inigar's room, containing a bed, chair, and several
  pegs on the wall. A woolen cloak hangs from one of these, and a thick
  quilt covers the bed. There is nothing else in the room.

14d. This door is locked, and leads to the cleric's room.
  A soft bed, desk, chair, and wooden chest are the only objects in the room.
  The chest is hidden under the bed. A small, jade image of the reptile 
  god (worth 75gp) is on the desk.  The chest is locked and protected by
  a glyph of arding that will paralyze a creature opening it for 3-18
  turns.
  The code word to open it safely is "EXPLICITICA". Within the chest
  is a clerical robe of black and crimson, a mace, and a scroll with
  two _cure light wounds_ spell
