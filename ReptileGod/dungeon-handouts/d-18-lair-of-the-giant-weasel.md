# 18. Lair of the Giant Weasel

The watery corridor leading to this muddy den may be waded through,
since it is only 2' deep. Because of the muck on the bottom,
however, movement is 1/4 the normal rate.

If the weasel has not been encountered as a wandering mosnter, it will be 
found in its lair. At the sound of a group approaching, it will enter the
corridor and attack.

Here is a torn leather pouch, as well as some rusty buckles, and a tattered
tunic.  Buried in the mud are 300gp and 800sp. A character who
digs through the mud will find 10% of these each turn spent searching.
