# 20. Troglodyte's Guardroom

This network of chambers gives access to the lower level of the dungeon,
and as such a permanent guard of troglodytes has been assigned here.

Each door will be barred on the side opposite the adventures approach. They
are difficult to force open (-1 penalty)

20a. The outer guard room has two troglodytes within, each carrying
  a stone battleaxe.  Three wooden benches are the only items of
  furniture in the room.  The trogs will release their stench as soon
  as the door is hit, and one will bang on the door leading to 20b and 20c to
  alert the other four trogs.  The latter will arrive in two rounds, and if
  the battle is still in progress, they will unbar the door and join the 
  melee

  If the first two guards have been killed, or i the four hear no sound
  beyond the door, they will leave the bar across it and wait for the
  party to come through. The four late arrivals are also armed with stone
  axes and have 10 hp apiece

20b. This is simpy a large, empty room

20c. This is where the guards sleep.  Many fishbones are  scattered
  around the floor, and there i a low table in the center of the room.

Each trog has a small leather pouch at its waist with a few coins inside.
The total carried by all six is 16gp, 20ep, 57sp, 180cp.
