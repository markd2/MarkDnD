# 23. Second Treasure Rom

From the entrance, this room appears to be filled with a pool
of murky brown water.

Hidden around a bend is a shelf of dirt and the cult's second 
treasure stash. 

A scret door, made of wood but plastered with mud to match the
wall, canb e opened by prying at the edge with a sharp
object like a sword or dagger.

Inside a small boat may be found.  Can carry two man-sized creatures,
or one character and an equivalent amount of treasure (2500gp weight)

On the hiddne shelf around the bend is a raised wooden platform
(like in area 4) with two medium-sized chests on it.  the chests are
locked. (poison needle trap), save at +3 b/c the poison has grown
stae.

300pp 600gp and 1000sp.  The other holds 600ep 1000gp jeweled 
bracelet, and 20 small gems worth 25 gp apiece.

MAYBE FIND A WEDDING GIFT TO CARRIE IN WITH THE TREASURE, since the
money came from the Orlane...
