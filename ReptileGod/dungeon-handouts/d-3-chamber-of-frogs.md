# 3. Chamber of the Frogs

Wooden door is swollen from the dampness, opening attempts at -1 penalty.

Box text:

Beyond the door is a room almost totally filled with a murky pool of water.
The smell of swamp gas is very strong here.  a thick, slime-covered
column rises from the center of the pool to support the sagging timbers
of the ceiling. Across the chamber, a small muddy shelf extends into the
pool.


Hiding in the water near the center of the pool are two killer frogs.

THey will attack anyone stepping through the door. The pool is 3'
deep throughout with an additional 1' of mud on the bottom.

Wading is 1/4 the usual movement rate.  No treasure.
The secret door is actually is a plug of dirt that fills a 3' diameter
hole.  It may be detected with the usal roll, allowing elves and half-elves
their bonus.
If noticed, the "door" may be removed in two turns of dilligent digging,
revealing a narrow tunnel that snakes back into a room.
