# 5. Cave-in

The west wall of the tunnel has collapsed here, buyring the supporting
timbers under tons of mud.  The widened cavern has a layer of
mud at least 3' deep over the entire floor.

Movement through this chamber is 1/4 normal speed for human and elves,
and 1/10 normal for dwarves and halflings
