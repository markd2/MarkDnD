# 4. Cult Treasure Chamber

The ceiling of this chamber is 8' above the floor.  Three large chests
resting upon a 5'x5' wooden platform are raised 1' above the muddy floor
in the center of the room.

This is a minor treasure room of the cult.

The sides of the platform are solid, so it can't be looked under without
lifting or destroying it.

The platform is hollow and empty beheath.  The hests are not trapped, but are
locked and bound with brass, making them virtuall impossible to break
by force

(-10% from a roll to _bend bars / lift gate_ allowing each player one roll.

First chest has 12,070cp, second 4,5600 sp and 450 ep,
third 87 ornamental stones (azurite, lapis lazuli, obsidian) worth an
average of 10gp apiece, and six semi-precious stones (onyx, zircon, 
and jasper), worth 25gp apiece.
