# 32. Empty Cave

The walls of this cave drip and glisten with moisture, but the area
is apparently empty.

If the party listens carefully they can hear trickling water and
faint creaking noises (from 29), but will not be able to 
detrmine the direction the noises are coming from.

Nothing of interest here.
