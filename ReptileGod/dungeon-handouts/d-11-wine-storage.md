# 11. Wine Storage

This room is stoutly locked. When the door is tried, a little dirt
will fall from the ceiling.  If the door is forced, a large
section of dirt will fall from the ceiling onto any characters 
within 10' of the door, doing 1-4 points of damage to each.

The room contains 15 caks and kegs, raised off the dirt floor on
wooden shelves.  Most of these contain the low-grade wine and
watery beer that is given to low-level cult members, but four small casks
are private stock for the reptile god and her higher minions.

These are all full. Two contain a strong, dark beer; THe other contain
Velunan Fireamber and Orlane Special wines.

The casks weigh 250 gp each, and are worth 100gp (beer) and 200gp (wine)
