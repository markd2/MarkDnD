# 7. Home of the Green Slime

The floor has a green mossy texture.


In the center of the muddy section of this corridor, a green slime awaits
the unwary foot.  If the party is prodding the mud before them, the
chance for surprise is normal, but if the characters merely walk through the
mud they will be surprised.
Movement through the mud is at half normal speed. The door just beyond
the pool is false.
