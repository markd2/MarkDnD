8a. The door is unlocked. In this room, four female cult members
  are sitting listlessly on wooden bunks. One is sharpening a spear,
  and the others have similar weapons near at hand.  They will attack
  strangers on sight. 

8b. This door is locked.  This empty room belongs to the four men on
  guard duty. Four bunks against the walls and a small table are the
  only items in here.

8c. This door is locked.  This room contains four cult spearmen,
  saleep  Their shields and spears are handy, but they will not stop
  to put on their armor in an emergency.
  If they are attacked without being alerted, they will have no action on
  first round and automatically lose initiative on the second round.

8d. Same as 8c, including four sleeping spearmen

8e. This room has a long table with benches to either side of it.
  Dirty platters and several stained mugs are strewn around the
  tabletop.  At the west end of the room is a small oven, vented
  through an 8" diameter hole in the ceiling. Several closed wooden
  boxes contain more platters, pans, mugs, several bottles of very
  low-grade wine, dried beans, and lard. Thre is nothing of
  interest or value here.
