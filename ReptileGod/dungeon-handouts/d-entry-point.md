# The Dungeon of the Reptile God

General Conditions

It's been excavated in an area of soggy dirt, not rock.
Corridors 10' and 10' wide unless otherwise indicated.
and at 5' intervals the walls and ceiling will be supported by massive,
usually slightly rotten timbers.
Wooden doors will be swollen with moisture and generally be stuck closed.

Dampness is inescapable, as are the smells of rot, mold, and swamp gas.
Floor is always wet and slippery, but in some areas a thick layer of mud
must be walked through. (shaded area)  Difficult terrain, so 1/2 the usual rate
when the group crosses one of these areas. Some areas are slowed even more
drasically.  Slurping sounds happen, eliminating any chance of surprising a 
quiet and stationary creature.

Water trickles everywhere, through the tunnels, working its way to the
pumproom (29). "mention frequenlty to distract the players"

There's wandering monsters and monster tables.
