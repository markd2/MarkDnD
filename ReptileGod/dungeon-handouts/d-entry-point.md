# The Dungeon of the Reptile God

HEADING NORTH AWAY FROM NEXTIA

John Parker takes another route to the south that's easier on the cart and horse,
but longer.

The first day of travel from Orlane will be spent crossing the grassy
plains east of the village. The farther from Orlane the party
progresses, the fewer signs of civilization will be seen.

Most of the farms here have been abandoned or are occupied by cult
members. No travelers have been met, since the trouble in Orlane has
put a halt to the caravan traffic. At the end of a day of traveling,
the farms will be left behind and the trees of the Dim Forest will be
visible in the distance. The trail has been following the track to
Hookhill thus far, but the party will need to pause for the night.


Early on the second day of travel, the party will enter this region of
permanent twilight. Moss dangles from the limbs over the party's
heads, and no sunlight pierces the thick greenery of the ancient
trees. This is a hushed wood; the common sounds of squirrels and birds
are missing. Several hours after entering the forest, the trail to the
dungeon parts from the track, veering sharply to the right. Because of
the lack of sunlight there is little underbrush, so the party may walk
two or three abreast if they desire. The remainder of this day and all
the next are spent following a faint trail across the forest floor.

At the end of the second day of travel in the forest, the trail will
reach the edge of a broad and fetid marsh. Thick rushes, interspersed
with patches of scummy water, stretch as far as the eye can see (even
if someone climbs one of the trees at the edge of the forest). Further
advance will involve wading through one or two feet of water and slimy
mud. The good news is that the trail is very obvious here, since the
rushes have been crushed out of the way to open the passage. It will
take one full day of travel to cross the short distance to the mouth
of the dungeon, since movement is very slow here.



the adventurers will see a low barrier in front of them. Soon
thereafter, they will reach this barrierâ€”a circular dike made from mud
and wood. The dike holds the swampwater back from a small island of
dry land, barely fifty feet across.

Entry to the dungeon is easy, since there is a gaping hole in the
ground at the center of the dry land. If a character looks down this,
he will see a muddy set of wooden stairs descending into the
earth. The corridor within is about 10' high and the same distance
wide.


General Conditions

It's been excavated in an area of soggy dirt, not rock.
Corridors 10' and 10' wide unless otherwise indicated.
and at 5' intervals the walls and ceiling will be supported by massive,
usually slightly rotten timbers.
Wooden doors will be swollen with moisture and generally be stuck closed.

Dampness is inescapable, as are the smells of rot, mold, and swamp gas.
Floor is always wet and slippery, but in some areas a thick layer of mud
must be walked through. (shaded area)  Difficult terrain, so 1/2 the usual rate
when the group crosses one of these areas. Some areas are slowed even more
drasically.  Slurping sounds happen, eliminating any chance of surprising a 
quiet and stationary creature.

Water trickles everywhere, through the tunnels, working its way to the
pumproom (29). "mention frequenlty to distract the players"

There's wandering monsters and monster tables.
