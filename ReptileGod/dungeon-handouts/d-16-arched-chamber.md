# 16. Arched Chamber

The door to this room is unlocked, and has been scorched by the
cult members with a large black X  _(and maybe a crude scrawl of
a Harpy)_

Within, four thick columns support the beams of an arched chamber ceiling,
25' high. A 20' wide, 20' high corridor leads from the southern side
of the room.

As soon as the harpy in room 17 hears the creatures enter, the evil
birdwoman will attempt to work the magic of her song.

All characters who save vs Spell will be unaffected by the harpy's song
for this encounter.  All failing will be _charmed_ by the singing.

They will approach the harpy and become bogged down in the mud
of the
connecting corridor.

The mud is 6' deep and especially thick - any creature trying to
cross it will become stuck fast about the midpoint.  Outside aid,
such as a ropes or poles, will be necessary to resuce stuck creatures.

Meanwhile the harpy will fly down the passage to attack the
rest of the party. She will attempt to strike with her
claws, charming any who fail a saving throw. (elves are 90% resistant)

Charmed characters will immediately stop their attacks on the harpy
but she will not tak the time to direct them to actively aid her.

If the harpy's victioms are not rescued, she will blind them with
a dagger taking from a previous victim and take them to her den.
If they are not rescued by comrades, the harpy will torture and
kill her "guests" at her leisure.  If a blinded victim is rescued,
a _heal_ or _regenerate_ spell will be necessary to restore sight.
