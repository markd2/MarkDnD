# 9. Storage Room

The door to this room is locked. Beyond, crates, barrels, cases, and
racks contain most of the dungeon's supplies.  Ten spears,
four daggers, and a shortsword are protected from dampness by a rack
on the wall.

The crates contain dried beans, wheat flour, cornmeal, potatoes, turnips,
oil, lard, and salt. TURNIPS!  Boxes of large spikes, several hammers,
a pile of stout timbers (20'), and four shovels are the building materials
present. Several dozen fresh torches are stored in a barrel.
