# 13. Small Meeting Room

Box text:

This chamber contains a small table and two comfortable chairs,
with an unopened wine bottle and two clean glasses on a shelf
in the corner.


As soon as a party enters room 13 or 14, the goblins in room 15
will spy upon them through slits in the secret doors.

All the secret doors are one-way only, from 15 into 13 or 14.

When the entire party has entered room 14, the nine goblins will
attack in groups of 3, one trio through each secret door.
