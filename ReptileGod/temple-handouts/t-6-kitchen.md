# 6. Kitchen

Three medium-sized ovens occupy the south wall, while
cupboards take up most of the storage space.  A small table is
in the center of the room. The cupboards contain grains, flour,
beans carrots, and dried meat

as well as pots, pans, platters, cups, and utensils enough to serve
several large and elaborate meals.
