# 18. Secret Altar Room

Box text:

This large room is dirty and unkempt, with shards of rock lying around
four crude granite statues s tanding about the room in haphazard locations.
In the south-east corner is a polished jade figure of a snake with a female
human head that is set apart from the other statues by its 
obviously superious crafting and material. 
Near it, a small cage with iron bars holds the listless figure of a 
beautiful young woman clothed in tattered rags. In addition, two
brass-bound chests sit next to the east wall.


This chamber provides proof of Abramo's corruption.

The woman Cirili Finla - no more than a girl. The daughter of the
village storekeeper.  Her listlessness will vanish with the prospect
of rescue.

She made the trek to the naga's lair with the rest of her family, but
some untapped reserve of courage and determinition prevented her
from succumbing to the charm.

Her youthful appeal struck a chord in Abramo's demented subconscious,
and he brought her back as his personal prisoner.  She has been 
beaten
and mistreated over the last three months, but her spirit has not been
broken. If Abramo is not yet dead, she will attempt to kill him if she
gets the chance.

She has seen the effect of the charm on her family and will not wish to
return to them. She understands that they would only betray her,
unless the charm can somehow be brroken.  

Cirlilli will relate everything she knows, but under no circumstances will
she return to the lair of the reptile GOd.  Cirilli knows the
chests were emptied recently, so the hoard is quite meager (12gp 14 sp 29cp)

THe jad statue is a skillfully carved image of the naga, whom Cirilli
will name as **Explicica Defilus**.  Shades of violet, brown, and green
jade have beenb lended into a materpiece of evil.  Light from torches or
lamps will cause the colors to swirl and shimmer in an almost hypnotic pattern.

Worht 7500gp intact and weighs 7500gp.  Impossible to break apart while
retaining any of its value.

The other statues in the room have been chipped from granite, and are as ugly
as they are poorly crafted. Abramo creatd them himself, explaned to
 the captive; so she can identify them as a crocodile, two large lizards, and
a coiled cobra.  The fragments of rock are the remnants of a
statue that has been shattered. (once a likeness of Merikka)

Behind the statue of the naga is as ecret trap door that leads to room
9 on the ground floor.  Only Abramo knows about it and will use it to escape
if hard pressed.
