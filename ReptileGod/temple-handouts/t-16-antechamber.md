# 16. Antechamber

The door to this area is unlocked. When it is opened,
several small bells attached to it chime softly.

Box text:

The walls of this chamber are scratched, stained, and covered
with strange markings. Loose chips of stone lie scattered on the
floor.  Aside from teh southeast exist, the room appears empty.


**Maneer Ecords**

This is the antechamber to the quarters **Abramo**, originally a
cleric of the gentle Merikka.  His charming by the naga and resultant
alignment change has seriously unbalanced his mind.

He has scrawled meaningless gibberish on the walls of this room
with soot and colored pigments.

Abramo will always be around the double corner at position (b)
watch the party. He will flee if the party appears too strong,
but will otherwise attack as suggested later.

"A good strategy for Abramo"
  - prayer self, with party in area of spell effect
  - cast silence on a coin and toss it into the party as they round the
    corner (negating party spellcasters)
  - charge the lead characters and melee, keeping the party jammed into
    the confined silenced space
  - if things go badly, can run into his room and bar the door.

DM may want to change this strategy if the party is very low level
or the players are new to the game.  Alternatively Abramo can be given
a _sanctuary_ spell or a few henchmen if the party is very strong.

May wish to playtest key encounters like this against the party 
characters before actually running it.
