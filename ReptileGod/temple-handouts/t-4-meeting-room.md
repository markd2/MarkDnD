# 4. Meeting Room

Box text:

This is apparently a larger room, divided by a rich blue drapery
just west of the door. The area that you see is empty except for
three plain wooden benches


Behind the drapery is a softly carpeted room with three comfortable
chairs placed around a low table. 

A small shelf to the side holds several unopened bottles of Orlanian
Special wine, and a half-dozen glasses
