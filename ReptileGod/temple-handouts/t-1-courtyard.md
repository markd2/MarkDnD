# 1. Courtyard 

During the day, the courtyard is open.  A broad path leads to the
doors of the temple.  The courtyad itself is empty except for a gardener,
and its grounds are not well tended.

If disturbed, the gardener will rudely direct the characters to the main
temple, then ignore them.

*after dark* - The gates to the temple are closed and barred from the 
inside, and two trained wolves are released to roam the courtyard. These
will obey any of the five servants who care for them.

The servants alternate the duty of patrolling, and two of them
will be with the wolves at all times.

If a fight breaks out, the three servants who are not on patrol will
hear it and join their comrades.
