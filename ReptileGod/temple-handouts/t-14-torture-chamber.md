# 14. Torture Chamber.

Box text:

A rack and a table with heavy straps attached to it occupy the center
of the room, and an iron maiden stands in the corner. Several empty
pine boxes, about 6' x 2' x 3' are stacked against the west wall.


What was formerlly a storage room for the ample supplies of grain
and WEGETABLES that the faithful provided for their cleric's
disposal has now been outrageously defiled. It is here that
**Derek Desleigh** does much of his dirty work.

Misha and Abramo also use the devices as a means of coaxing 
information from reluctant citizens before they have been converted.
