# 12. Library

Box text:

This room contains many shelves of books, and two small tables.


Most of the volumes deal with mundane aspects of agriculture or
religion.  The most ornate book in the room is on one of the
tables, entitled _A most worshipful Guide to Benign Merikka"

This huge and richly embossed volume will not fit on the shelves.
Contains many colorful paintings and was formerly very valuable,
but all the illustrations have been crudely defaced.  
Some of the pages have rusty brown spots on them.
