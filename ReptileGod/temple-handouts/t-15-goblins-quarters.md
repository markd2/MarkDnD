# 15. Goblin's Quarters

Box text:

This room is barren, except for nine straw mats and a low, crudely-built
table.


The nine goblins who live here were captured by the cult's
members in the Dim Forest and dragged to the dungeon of the
reptile god. There they were charmed and ordered to serve as
temple guards, out of sight of the citizens of Orlane.
