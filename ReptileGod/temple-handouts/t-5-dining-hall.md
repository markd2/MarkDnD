# 5. Dining Hall

This is the room where the clerics, monks, and servants all take
their meals together.  The pretense of goodness is maintained in 
a handsome display case, which contains examples of some of the
finer harvests to come from the Orlane area:
a huge carrot, a plump ear of corm, a cluster of tall wheatstalks,
and a bottle of the local wine.
