# 17. Abramo's Chamber

Box text:

This room is decorated in a bizarre fashion. There is a dirty straw
pallet on the floor, yet two soft and expensive armchairs rest at a low
table. A beautiful robe hangs on the wall above a battered, locked chest,
while thef loor is strewn with muddy rags. An exquisely crafted wooden
desk has been placed near the north-east corner of the room.  At various
points around the walls, small iron hooks for hanging tapestries have been
into the stone.


Nothing of value in the room. The rags are barely recognizable as 
tapestries. At one time, these showed pastoral harvest scenes.
the desktop is covered with insane scribblings in the lawful evil
alignment tounge: "snake mother" and "a crocodile has many teeth"

The chest contains only ripped clothing of poor quality, and worthless
fragments of ivory that once made up a statue of Merikka.

The secret door to room 18 used to be maked with a tapestry, and now
may be detected at +1. it is opened by simply pulling a hidden switch on
the desk.

This door can be barred from the other side.  If Abramo passes through
the door and bars it, he will be able to escape through the secret door in
room 18 before the party can break in.

Abramo carries a ring of keys on his belt at all times, including
the keys to his chest and the chests in room 18.
