# 3. Central Sanctuary

Box text:

This large room has a tile floor decorated with an abstract mosaic 
pattern in orange, tan, brown, and blue.
Several tapestries decorate the walls, all depicting scenes of lush farmland
and crops in various stages of maturity. Five huge elm trunks serve as
columns in the room, and a statue of Merikka, carved from a solid piece
of jade, is mounted on a low dais at the north end of the room.


If the adventurers are just visiting, they will be met here by
**Misha Devi**, a priestesss of the temple (see room 9). She will
cauton tem that non-members are not allowed beyond this area.  She will
answer quetions politely and try to find out what the characters are
doing in the area without revealing any information of importance.

She will not let the characters get too close to her, and if the party
is hostile, she will flee and warn the rest of the temple.

Or the DM could have the characters meet a temple servant, with 
similar results.

statue is worth 5000 gp but weighs 10,000 gp
