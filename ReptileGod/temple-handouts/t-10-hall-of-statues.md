# 10. Hall of Statues

Box text:

This hall has a gleaming white tile floor and a series of alcoves
along the east well.  Each alcove is lined with black velvet to
highlight the beautiful golden items there.


All the statues represent platns that Merikka's benign blessing helps
to nurture. Each contains an amount of gold equal to 500gp, but the
crafsmanship of the statues makes them worth 5000gp each

North to south, replicas of:
  wheat, potato, cluster of oats, cornstalk, large carrot,
  three turnips, a bunch of grapes, and cluster of barley, and a pile
  of beans.

intracitely molded statues of pure gold

The fact the minions have let the exquisite items remain in their
traditional spots should suggest that it is best not to tamper ith them.
Merikka's curse will immediately befall anyone who touches one of them.

Curses from touching more than one item are cumulative, but only
the individuals who actually handle the tatues are cursed.

Saving throughvs spells is allowed for each curse, with those saving
suffering a -2 penaltiy for all dice rolls for three days.  Failure means
the curse will be permanent until a cleric of at least 12th level casts
remove curse and atonement on the culprit
