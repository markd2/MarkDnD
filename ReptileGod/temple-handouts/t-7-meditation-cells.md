# 7a-e. Meditation Cells

These were formerly used as places for clerics to pray to the
gentle Merikka, but that use is long forgotton. Now each contains
only a simple reed prayer mat.

a. empty

b, c, d - Occupied by a single evil monk

e. Prayer mat here covers a trapdoor to the lower level (19)

If the west door is opened, all three monks will be ready for combat
(not surprise) but won't fight unless one of the cell doors is opened.

The one who has been disturbed will fight in his room, while the other
two will spring into the hallway to the aid of their fellow.

All three fight with bare hands.  No treasure.  Cells empty save for reed mats
