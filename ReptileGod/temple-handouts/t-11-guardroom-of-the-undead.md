# 11. Guardroom of the Undead

(upstairs)

Box text:

This bare room contains only some wooden benches and 7 skeletons
standing aginst the walls between them.


The unded will remain motionless until a living creature enters
the room.  If that creature makes the secret sign of the cult, the
skeletons remain motionless and allow them free passage.

Of not, they all attack as soon as the first creature has entered the
room, fighting until they are destoryed or the intruders driven off.
