# Temple of Merikka

Temple of Merikka was dedicated to the benign goddess when it was
constructed from granite blocks brought from the Lortmil Mountains.

The Naga's possession of the two clerics and their servants has
made a mockery of the church's original purposes. Weekly services are
still held to keep up the prtense, the clerics are among the cult's most
adamant proponents.  They play an active role in the deception of
unsuspecting victims.

The granite wall around the temple is 20' high.  
The gates are strong and wooden.
Carved into them with precise craftsmanship is an ornate carving of
the chaotic good goddess Merikka, portrayed as a beautiful young woman.

The temple itself is made of solid granite blocks, and is completely
windowless.
