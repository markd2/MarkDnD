# Ideas

### At figboot's

* Mel talk about the giant veggies.  "Giant alligators"
* Floon can relay some rumors. "Folks have been talking about Orlane
  for a while.  Hochoch's been mentioned too"
* Boz'lee gives everyone a little clear bracelet.  "if you get into
  bad trouble, we can hopefully find you."
  (during battle with E.D, if it's going really bad, Boz'lee will show
  up with a portal "FALL BACK!  FALL BACK HERE!" and let them heal up and
  maybe long rest in a temporal pocket.


### On the Route to Orlane

* Cultists are Red Lectroid "John X" names, and kind of talk like the
  cultists in _Return of the Archons_

* they find a dude (**John Parker**, cultist) with a wagon with a
  broken, muddy wheel, kind of cool and wide.  Wagon is empty, save for
  some empty sacks.  This is the wagon that takes folks to the Dungeon.
  They'll see it by the BAD_INN, and will behave like the other cultists,
  maybe they'll connect the dots before it's too late.

* Maybe have a small troglyate attack - John Parker will only join in when
  it's obvious the trogs will lose.  "I was protecting my wagon. It's
  all I got"
