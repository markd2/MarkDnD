### On the Route to Orlane

* Cultists are Red Lectroid "John X" names, and kind of talk like the
  cultists in _Return of the Archons_

* they find a dude (**John Parker**, cultist) with a wagon with a
  broken, muddy wheel, kind of cool and wide.  Wagon is empty, save for
  some empty sacks.  This is the wagon that takes folks to the Dungeon.
  They'll see it by the BAD_INN, and will behave like the other cultists,
  maybe they'll connect the dots before it's too late.
