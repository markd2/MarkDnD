Box text:

This is the only stone structure in Orlane.  A wall of granite
blocks surrounds the temple, and sturdy wooden gates, give access
to a courtyard. the temple is on the highest piece of land in Orlane,
a full 20' above the stream and pond.


Cult members! (duuuuh)

The gate to the courtyard will be standing open during the daylight hours,
but will be shut and barred with the setting of the sun.

Vigorous pounding after dark will uually (100% at sunset, -5% for each hour
thereafter) bring a servant to open them.  If the characters enter, go
to the Temple Map.
