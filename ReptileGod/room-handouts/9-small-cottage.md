# 9. Small Cottage

Box text:

This small, square building has been freshly white-washed. 
Heavy curtains hang over the windows, and the door is shut.

Home of two elves.

Dorian and Llywillan

The townsfolk are suspicious of the pair.

Only the mayor (location 10) why they are here - he has asked them to
investigate the strange occurrences in Orlane

Learned that an evil cult is somehow controlling the minds of certain
citizens, including
* the two clerics of the temple (21)
* proprietor and regular customers of the Golden Grain Inn (6)
* The constable (2)
* The blacksmith (15)

The elves will not reveal this information unless they are absolutely
certain that the party is opposed to the cult.

Any elves in the party will cause the pair to feel a natural affinity
toward their cousins, but will not lessen their caution.

The party will have to engage in combat and capture or slay some of the known
cult members to win their trust.

When they are convinced that the part is an aly, they will share the
information.  Will not join the group for exploring the town or the dungeon.

They will remain in their cottage during the day, 80% at night they are out 
observing the template or the Golden Grain Inn.

Small metal box on the cupboard. Locked, (llywillan carries the key in his
quiver)  Thief can try to pick it at -10%.  If pried open, releases
_sleep gas_ for 3-18 hours.  (elves are highly resistant to this). Roll time
seperately for each character.  (inside the chest, so find/remove traps won't
work)

Contains 200pp, 55gp, and this note:

```
Dorian and Ilywillan,

Much has happened in my life since we fought side by side in the troll
war. I hope, sometime, to have achance to talk with you about the
many pleasant things

My purpose now, sadly, is to ask - nay, beg - my courageous comrades to aid
my people in a time of dire need.  I cannot even describe to you the danger that
threatens Orlane, for I know not its true nature. I do know that,
unless it can somehow be stopped, this evil will consume my little village and
its family. We will vanish without trace into the dust of history.

A sinister force is at work here, and it is made all the more frightening by 
the fact that its true nature is conealed in a web of fear and suspicion.
I plead with you, come to Orlane, lend your skills to revealing this 
menace, that it may finally be destroyed!

Your Comrade, Zakarias Ormond, Mayor of Orlane
```
