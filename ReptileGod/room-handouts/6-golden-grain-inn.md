# 6. Golden Grain Inn

Box Text:

This is a large wooden inn.  It is decorated with carving of sheaves of
wheat along the eaves of the roof.  The inn was whitewashed at one time,
but much of the paint has peeled. A sign picturing a cluster of wheat
and a pitch of ale hangs over the door.  A corral and stable apparently
empty, are off to the side.


They may see the wagon behind the Inn they encoutered on the road.

Inside the Golden Grain is another map
