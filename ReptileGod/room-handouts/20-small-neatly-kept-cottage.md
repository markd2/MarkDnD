# 20. Small, neatly kept cottage

Box text:

Brilliant flower gardens surround this quaint little home.
Clean shutters flank several large windows, and fancy curtains are
visible inside. The building is sheltered by several large elm trees.


Home of Vilma Merridie, elderly widdow.

Physically weak and unable to walk more than a few feet between rests.

An astute observer of occurrences in Orlane.

She and her husband moved to the village 50 years ago, occupying
24 (abandoned farm) together until his death.

For last 8 years she has lived here, doing small mending and tending
chores for neighbors to earn a few coppers.

Lives off the considerable sum that the couple accumulated over
40 years of farming.  Wears a number of jeweled rings

Invite visitors in and invite them in for tea or wine. Willing to talk
and has much information to share, but if not questioned, she will
ramble through an animated disseration about the old days.
Tend to return to this topic with regularity, even when specific questions
are being asked, but will supply answers in a roundabout way.

Info
  * strongly suspects carpenter (14), smith (15), 
    farmers in (18 - true) and (19 - false),
    the clerics and temple servants (21), farmer at 22, and
    the two people (doesn't know they're elves) living near the mayor (false)

Has no factual basis for her suspicions.
* "Family across the road (19) used to be real nice, they they act suspicious
  twoard everyone, even me!"
* never liked the family at farm 18, and report seeing the lads go out at all
  hours
* smith has always been an ill-tempered lout, but lately "just no talking to
  the man!"
* has a high opinion of the mayor and hopes the two strangers don't bring him
  any harm.
* if asked where to stay for the night, will recommend the In of the 
  Slumbering Serpent

Will readily admit she doesn't know much about occurrences on the west end 
of town. "I don't get out too much, you know..."

She's seen scaly humanoids with fin-like crests on their heads crossing
north of her cottage and climbing the walls of the temple.

She boldly states she no longer allows the clerics to visit her, saying
they changed after going away suddenly for a week about a year ago.

She wears several rings on each hand decorated with a variety of
stones.  worth 1000, 800, 500, and 200 gp.

She's been af faithful worshipper of Merikka throughout. If any harm is
done to her including theft, the goddess will see that a run of bad
luck falls on the perpetrator. Will affect party members and cult members
aliek, consists of a -2 penalty for the next 3 days on rolls that
the character group makes (including initiative and surprise rolls).
"All rolls are affected"
