# 4. Dairy Farm

Box Text.

This house and barn are clean, whitewashed wooden buildings.
Several cows chew their cud just outside the barn. Three little
girls playing in the yard of the house stop to gawk at your group.

75% chance an older sister of the girls will see any strangers on the road
and rush outside to hustle the little ones in.

Should eventually meet Nowell Graven, dairyman

Five daughters who share the house.  Wife, and mother-in-law.

Kindly man, judgement tells him that the strangers are friendly, might even
invite them in for tea and cheese.

Concerned about matters in Orlane, but can offer no explanations
