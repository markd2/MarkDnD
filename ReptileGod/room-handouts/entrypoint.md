### Box Text

_From Hochoch, The Realstream is quickly crosseda at a shallow ford, and
you follow a caravan track that winds along the south side of a narrow
creek. The plains here are flat and grassy. Occasionally, large cottonwood 
trees grow along the stream, but in general the plain is unforested._

_For several days, you pass through an uninhabited region with no untoward
experiences. Finally staying always to the right of the creek, the track
enters a region of prosperous farms surrounded by fields of grain or
pastures for cows and goats._

_Early on the fourth afternoon of the trip, a cluster of buildings and trees
becomes visible ahead, with the stone walls of a template beyond - ORLANE_

_At the outskirts of Orlane, a large grove of elms is visible to the left,
while several wooden buildings border the road to the right._
