# 17. Decrepit Farmhouse and Collapsed Barn

Box text:

Doors and shutters swing freely here. The whole appearance is one
of the abandoned desolation. Weeds choke the yard before the house.


Inside the house, searches will find articles of clothing, cooking
utensiles, and moldy scraps of food in closed cupboards. It is obvious
that the residents left suddenly. There are two bedrooms in teh house, one
with a double-bed and the other with two small bedds.  A family of four
lived here until the trogs and cult members drgged them off to the
dungeon of the reptile god 9 months ago.  Got eaten by crocodiles.
