# 5. Weaver's House and Shop

Box text:

A sign with a spinning wheel and a loom hangs outside this new building.
Several bales of wool are stacked on the wide porch.  No people are visible.

Front part of the building contains a shop, with Galen Weaver.

Runs his large loom while his wife works a spinning wheel.

NEED NAME for wife
NEED TO GENDERSWAP

Many piles of wool, yarn, and cloth lie about in a state of confusion.

A small bell will ring if the door is opened, bringing the weaver from his
home behind the shop.

A young man, newly married and moved to Orlane trying to make a go of
his first business.  His wife is attractive and they are both friendly.

If questioned, they will respond that "people are strange hereabouts"
and they know no reason for their neighbors' aloofness.

Welcome the chance to talk to outsiders, even inviting a small group in
for a glass of wine if the time of day is appropriate.

If the conversation continues for aw hile, they will warn strangers that
the Golden Grain Inn is a strange place, to be avoided if at all possible.
