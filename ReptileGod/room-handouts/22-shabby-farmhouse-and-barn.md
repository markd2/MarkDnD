# 22. Shabby Farmhouse and Barn

Box text:

This residence gives the impression that it has seen much use and that
its owners hae had little time for improving its apperance.  A small
child is playing next to the house and several chickens and a huge rooster
poke about the yard.


Cult members!

The family has been recently converted.

Consists of a husband, wife, adult daughter, their son, son-in-law,
and the younger couple's small child.

Farm is well-run, though battered (it has looked that way since long
before the family's indoctrination) Large stores of barley wheat and corm
are in the barn.

A small vinyard west of the house is lush with ripe grapes.

All the persons here have been slightly numbed by their recent
experience with the Naga and will appear distant and removed if talked
to.  Will be neither friendly nor hostile, and questions have to be
repated several times before getting an answer.

Because of the confused state of the family, shrewed questions might gain 
some useful information.  Their attention span is too short for them
to conduct any significant conversation.
