# 1. Pleasant Farmhouse and Barn

Box Text:

This wooden house is surrounded by attractive flower gardens, with a small
barn beyond.  A teenage girl is churning butter on the porch, but she sees
your group and runs into the house at your approach.  Shadowy forms are
visible behind closed curtains.

Farmer HEWITT TWAINE
Two grown sons

watch strangers suspiciously through the windows

wife and daugther hide in the kitchen at the rear.

If anyone stops, Hewitt will do all the talking
  - Polite, but quiet

Will never allow strangers inside his house.

Understands his town has changed drastically, but does not know why.

Barn is well-stocked with corm and wheat. Dozen goats are penned in teh back.
