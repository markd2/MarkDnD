# 25. Inn of the Slumbering Serpent

Box text:

A large, colorful sign pictures a red dragon with its head resting
contentidely on its paws.  A plume of smoke rises from the serpent's
nose and its eyes are closed.  This inn is smaller and older than the
Golden Grain.  Several beds of flowers brigthen the front, however,
and the large middle-aged woman sweeping the porch looks cheerful.
She greets you with a friendly wave and a "Hello Neightbor"


Belba Cralloon.  She and her husband Ollwin run this inn.

Possess the knack of making a wearly traveler feel at home.  At any
pause on the part of a group, she will bustle down the porch
steps and invite them inside.
