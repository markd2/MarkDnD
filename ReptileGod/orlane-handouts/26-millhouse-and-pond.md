# 26. Millhouse, Waterwheel, and Pond

Box text:

Around this large mill is scattered much in the way of children's
toys, tools, and farm implements. The most imposing part of the struture
is the tall millhouse, but it is obvious that afamily lives in another
wing of the building.  Two children play in the yard, but stop and stare
at the sight of your group.

If the group approaches, the youngest will run for the house.
The other, 10 yo, will squint at the party as it advances, mimicking
the tance of a belligerent adult.

Obviously the home of the village miller and his family (wife and 9 children)
Shortly after the child enters the house, the miller, Kenton Miller,
and four adult sons, will emerge. The man will call his younger son back to
him and await the party on the porch.

The miller is by nature a friendly man, but recent events have made him
suspicious of even his neighbors.  He will feel farily safe with his
sons backing him up, and will spend a little time in conversation
with strangers.  He will only discuss things such as the weather, or
his work. 

He has no specific knowledge of the cult in any event, although he is 
aware of some strange goings-on at the Golden Grain Inn, much activity late
at night, and many strangers lurking there.  

And that cart squeaking out at all hours
