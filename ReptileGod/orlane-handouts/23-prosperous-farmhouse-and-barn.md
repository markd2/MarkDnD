# 23. Prosperous Farmhous and Barn

Box text:

Two small children play in the yard, but at the sight of the
party they imediately run for the house.  This building
looks solidy constructed and hsa been recently whitewashed.
The barn is a clean structure, though not painted, and several goats
wander in a small corral.  A pen housing an immense pig is visible
just south of the barn.

Farmer, Alan Clayborn, is a ranger.  Retired from adventurous life
with his wife Marieke.  Three small children.

Have been very successful as farmers, and the barn is well-stocked with
corn, oats and beans.  Beside the five goats and the pig, they are the
proud owners of two mules.

Although retired from actively seekign adventure, the couple is proud
and resolute in thir detemrination to succeed, and are determiend to
defend their home and family with every means at their disposal.

Alan will be polite but firm in dissuading any questioners.  Has noticed
too many odd things occurring around Orlane to take chances by inviting
strangers in.  Will give a secret sign that any ranger of the party has
a 50% chance of noticing.  If so, Alan will take the group into his
confidence.

NEXT MAYBE MAKE ALAN A MONK

his knowledge of the cult will be minimal. Will be aware that his neighbors
to the east (22) mysteriously left their home one night and were gone
for tend days. Since he didn't know the family ery well before their
departure, he has not noticed any significant changes in their behavior.

Also, may mention the strange, bedraggled figure, apparently an old
man, who seems to live in the grove of trees to the west. "he's a hermit
who keeps to himself"
