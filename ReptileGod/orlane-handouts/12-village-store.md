Box text:

This is a fairly well-kept establishment with an assortment of
farm implements and cooking utensils on the wide porch.
The door stands open, and a well-painted sign depicting a pot,
a plow, a sack, and a lantern hangs over all.

Husband, wife, and three grown sons will all fight if necessary.

Husband, wife greet customers in the store.  Sones remain screened by
a curtain leading to the back porch, aiming cocked crossbows at strangers.

if the visitors are hostile or too curious, the sons will step forward
and demand that they leave the store.

If strangers behave violenty, the sons will shoot first and then leap into
the room with swords drawn.

The storekeeper and wife will put on a friendly front with customers,
knowing that their sons are backing them up.  Mundane items such as cooking
pots or sacks of meal will be available.  PHB items (75% chance). Weapons
and armor (20% chance) separately for each item.
