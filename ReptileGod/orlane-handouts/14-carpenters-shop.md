14. Carpenter's Shop

Box Text

A wooden board in the shape of a saw hangs before this well-constructed
building. The front part of the structure is unwalled, and inside of
this breezy area the carpenter is at work. Many tols (saws, hammers,
nails, prybars) are scattered about, and some boards are mounted on
sawhorses.

Cult members!

Carpenter and his wife are very recent cult initiates.

Their teenage son and daughter may stillbe alive in the snakepits
(resisted the Naga's charm)

The carpenter serves as a furniture maker as well as a builder, and
numerous examples of his handiwork are placed around his shop.

Tables, chairs, and desks - all of exquisite craftsmanship., may be
seen.  The table under construction is more shoddily put together, as are
the pair of chairs he has just completed.  They are waiting a coat of stain,
all the other furniture is finished.

The wife will spy upon strangers through a small hole in the door
of the house. She carries a longsword smeared with snake venom and attack
hysterically (+1 on to-hit) if husband appears to be in danger.  It's
old venom, so folks struck save at +4.

The carpenter has designed a clever secret panel in his bedroom that
will slip aside to allow access to a compartment beyond (like a secret
door). Hidden a wooden box, carved with intricate leafy patterns. Worth
400gp intact.  only the carpenter knows what combination of leaves to
press or twist to pen. contains treasure. (theif may open it at -15% on
