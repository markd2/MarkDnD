# 10. Mayor's Residence

Box text:

This house is set well back from the road, and is partially screened by a pair
of medium-sized elms.

This is by far the most imposing house in the village. The walls have been
regularly whitewashed and the roof gleams with new wooden shingles.

A wide porch crosses the entire front of the house, and columns of wood 
support the overhanging roof. The columns have been carved into leafy
patterns by a skilled craftsman

Home of the villge mayor and family. Zakarias Ormond.
Retired but capable 3rd level fighter (weapons and armor in a bedroom
closet).

The mayor's cheerful wife and two daughters live here, and two
older sons.

Personal Bodyguard is also in the house.

He's polite and curious with starngers, and is willing to spend hours
conversing. He is discreet, seeking information more readily than giving it
away.

Astute leader and has recongized that something is warping the people of
his village.

He has associated the changes with recent midnight disapperances, noticing
that the folks who return are somehow in an altered state.  He is
convinced that the storekeeper (12), smith (15), the carpenter (14) and
the clerics are all members of teh secret order.

False hypothesis - the old hermit in the grove west of town is behind the
whole thing.  Lack of proof has kept him from acting on this assumption.

old bodyguard - Traver Stoutheart (F5) - stay concealed in a curtained 
alcove until needed.  Gruff, uncomunicative old soldier who will spring
from his hiding place at the first some of an overt act against the mayor.

Behind the mayor's house is his woodcarving workshop, with tools,
woodshavings, and some fine pieces of hardwood lying about. The mayor
did the carvings on teh columns and the house.

Half-finished remarkably lifelike bust of his wife.
