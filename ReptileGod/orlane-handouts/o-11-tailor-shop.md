# 11. Tailor Shop

box text

A sign crudely depicting a needle piercing the seat of a pair of
pants hangs before this establishment, a small ramshackle building
in need of considerable repair.  A shutter hangs loosely, shingles are
missing from the roof, and the walls show signs of rot in several places.


Home of village trailor, meek elderly bachelor Myron Tweed.

He is terrified of strangers and will answer no questions.

if asked to do some tailoring, he will allow only one person at a time in
his shop, and will be nervous and fretting the whole time.
