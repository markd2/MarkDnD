13. Rundown Farmhouse

This house is in desperate need of repair. The front door, porch steps,

condition, but the many chickens in the yard suggest that the place is
indeed inhabited.

Cult members!

Farmer and adult son live here.

Men are rude and untalkative, and will claim to be busy with work
