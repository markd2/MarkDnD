# 27. Grove of stately elms

Box text:

The narrow trail winds among majetic elms, at times disappearing into
thick shrubbery.  The bushes between the trees are dense, rising to
a height of 8 or 10 feet. The elms themselves average 75' tall, and theya
are the only trees here. They are widly spaced, allowing much sunlight to
pour between their ancient boughs.


The venerable hermit has a ramshackle cottage on the far side of this smal
grove.

Ramne - bent and graybeared resident is a loner, and none of the village 
people have gotten to know him.  7th-level magic user.

Ring of protection +2, and a gnarled wooden staff (not magical).

Been living in this one-room hut for over a decade and is quite comfortable
here. Rarely leaves the grove, and his legs are weak and tires easily

Has a familiar, a clever weasel named Whiskers - hasa powerful sense
of smell and can trail the troglodytes to their lair in the rushmoors, even
if the trail is old.

Usually whiskers is perched on Ramne's shoulders.

Despite his feeble appearance, Ramno knows more about the cult than anyone
in Orlane.  Has gathered this knowledge through patient observation.
He desipises the cult, and will be willing to aid a group that acts towards
its destruction, but only after convince of the party's integrity.

Might take several weeks, dependign on the group's activities.  If they 
defeat a band of trogs, the time period may be shortened. But if they
stay at the Golden Grain Inn, it will take longer.

Lead-lined wizard-locked box under the floor has his store of magical items.

If he aids the party, he will bring them along
  - elven cloak, healing potion x2, potion of speed, wand of wonder with
8 charges.  - reluctantly use indoors or undergound, had bad experience
when cast a lightnign bolt in a small cave many years ago.

outside of unusual circumstances, such as a showdown with cult members
in town, Ramne wil not extend his aid to the group until they're readly
to depart from Orlane and seek the HQ of the cult.  If th group asks for
help, he will tell tehm Whiskers should be able to follow the trail
to the reptile god's lair.

Even if asked, will never reveal his class or level.

BORK WANTS TO AVOID SENDING HIM ALONG, maybe he can be with Boz'lee if 
things totaly turn toes-up.
