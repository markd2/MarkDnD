15. Blacksmith's Shop

Box text:

This is obviously a smithy though no sign hangs here. The shop part of the
building is unwalled, and two  brawny lads operate a bellows while a giant of
a man hammers thunderously upon a piece of metal that will soon becoe
the blade of the shovel. Soot and smoke abound.


Cult members!

The smith, his wife, and their two sons and daughters have been members
for nearly a year.

Man still does his work with the mechanical precision that has allowed him
to maintain the quality that he has been known for.

Formerly a short-tempered and irritable man, the charm of the Naga has
unbalanced his mind slightly. 25% chance that the approach of strangers will
cause him to fly into a violent rage, threatening them with the wrath of
the gods if they do not flee at once.  his sons will attempt to restrain
him, but if an individual or group continues to approach, the smith will
break free and attack.

Even if he does not fly ito a rage, the smith is unpelsant and
rude in conversation. Any slightly aggressive or faintly insulting
comment will probably (66%) cause him to become enraged, sons unable to
hold him as he rushes forward.  Support father in combat.

because of their size and strength, all three are formidable foes, though they
fight at 0 level.

smith will use his hammer as a weapon and the sons will grab shortswords.
have leather aprons, so some AC.
