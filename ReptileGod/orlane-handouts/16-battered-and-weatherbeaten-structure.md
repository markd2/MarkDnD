# 16. Battered and Weatherbeaten Structure

Box text:

The doors and windows of this large building are boarded up. A sign
lies face-down in the weeds before the proch, which may be reached by
clmbing three broken steps.  The roof has several gaping holes, and the
general appearance of the place suggests it has been long abandoned.


The sign in the weeds, if looked at, reads in faded paint, "FOAMING MUG INN"

has been abandoned for nearly a year, following an attempt by the cult
to kidnap the proprietor and his family.

Was foiled by the by the courage of several citizens and a fierce fight
followed, during which all the citizens at the inn, as well as several
cult members were killed.

The battle remains a mystery to the rest of the village, and has been
dismissed as just another aspect of the mysterious problem besetting Orlane.

Not really abandoned. If the party should break in or discover the secret door
in the rear wall, will find the ground floor in a state of total disarray, left
as if following the fight.


VVV ALREADY DONE VVV


A cellar door is visible, hanging on one hinge and a creaky staircase leads
into darkness.

Cellar is gloomy and smells musty and rotten.  Characters may notice
(50% chance, 90% for elves), a foul swampy stench i nthe air.  Cellar is
one large room with several crates of spoiled foodstores and three
kegs of wine (still good).

Two doors lead to smaller storage rooms: 
L  * fruit cellar  empty
R  * and a toolroom - the source of the odor, 3 troglodytes

They will have heard the party descend the stairs and will be hiding.
if the door to the toolroom is opened, they wil l attack savagely.

Small sack in an empty toolcrate behind the door, contains 7pp 80gp
120 ep, 130sp and 5 100 gp gems.  Toolroom contains hammers, nails,
some long timbers, and a saw.
