# 18. Farmhouse and Barn

Box text:

This farm looks moderately prosperous. The house and barn are in good
repair, although several flower gardens that used to bloom
in the yard have become choked with weeds. A strapping youth is splitting
wood in the yard beside the house.


Cult members!

Home of a woman and her three grown sons.  Husband died many years ago,
but the four of them have managed the farm quite well.

Been cult members for nearly a yer, and men quite active in recruting new
members - help trogs subdue captives of the cult and use a farm cart
(now behind golden grain (6))

Thye have become good at this - with first-level theif skills,
_strike from behind_ and _moving silently_

If the mother's suspicions toward the party are aroused, she will detail
one or two of her sons to spy on the group and report on its activities,
and will keep the clerics informed.
