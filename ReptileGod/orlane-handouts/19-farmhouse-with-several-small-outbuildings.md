# 19. Farmhouse with several small outbuildings

Box text:

The smell of this area identifies it as a hog farm. In addition to swine,
many chickens scratch about the yard.  While a rooster and
several turkeys strut regally. A teenage boy watches from the
porch of the house.


If anyone approaches the house the lad will run inside, returning
with his father.

This proud farmer has been disturbed by changes in his community and
will send visitors on their way quickly.

He will answer no questions, and if a group persists in trespassing,
he will display a loaded crossbow that he has concealed on the porch,
ordering them off his land.

The son and wife have hidden in the house.  Boy has a crossbow aimed
out a window, while mother waits behind the door with a spear.
