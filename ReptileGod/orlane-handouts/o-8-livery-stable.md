8. Livery Stable

Box text:

This is an exceedingly run-down structure of wood. Faint traces of a former
paint job cling to small parts of the walls, but in some places the bar wood
has started to rot.

A fenced walkway leads from the road to the back of the house, and horse 
manure is scattered liberally about.

A little boy, his face covered with dirt, is playing on the front porch.
As you approach, he toddles out to th road, smiles, and says "HI"


THis is the village stable, as the characters' noses will already have
suggested.  Much of the ground has been trampled into mud.

The front of the dilapidated house is sheltered by a wide porch.

Appearances aside, the liveryman is quite well-to-do.  Not concerned with
presenting a front of wealth and polish.

Kilian Gade, wife, and three small children.

Wife is timid, but 80% chance she will see her son talking to strangers.
If so, she will rush out to collect him, staring at the party with fearful
eyes as she snatches him up.

If a character makes a friendly comment, she will stop, embarassd some
explanation about "mealtime" and dash in the house.

Kilian is at work in the stables but wife willc all him after any encounter
with players. He will hurry to the house.
If the party is still in front when gets there, he steps outside to
apologize for his wife's hastiness

"These are strange times, you understand..." 

He is affable and willing to carry on a conversation.  
Will keep guests on teh porch.

He can't explain the forces at work in the village, but he is very
observant.

After some small talk, will begin to share his knowledge

Suspicious of the two strangers who moved into the cottage across the
road (9) several weeks ago.  "They don't seem to be interested in mixing
with anybody"

He shares the weaver's apprehensions about the Golden Grain Inn, and recommend
the inn of the Slumbering Serpent for its superior wine and friendly
atmosphere.

After an hour of conversaton, he will mention his neighbors at the 
general store (12).  "They up and disappeared a couple of months ago;
gone fer nearly a fortnight, then the whole family came back.  Didn't
even leave one of the boys to mind the store!"

Stable contains 4 light horses, 2 draft horses, 3 mules, 2 oxen,
and 2 small carts.
