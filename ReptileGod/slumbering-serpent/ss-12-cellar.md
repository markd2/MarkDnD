# 12. Cellar

This is a large, open room supported by two central columns. Between the columns
are many crates containing supplies for the inn - platters, mugs, towels,
cheap silverware, a saw, an axe, and several spare hinges.

More crate along the north and west walls contain stores of food, beans, grain,
flour potatoes, carrots, dried and smoked meat, and several kegs of beer.

The outside cellar door is locked and barred when not in use.

Many long plants been piled along the south wall.  A box containging a hammer
and hundreds of nails sits on top of these boards.  Nothing here of special
interest.
