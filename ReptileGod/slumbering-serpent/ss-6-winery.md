# 6. Winery

THis is Ollwin's pride and joy.

Fermenting here are some of the finest grapes grown for many leagues, slowly
turning int oboth red and white wines of excellent quality.

The outer room is a small office with a desk and many records of different
batches of wines, ranging back for nearly 40 years.

The large inner room has huge vats of grapes in various stages of fermentation.
Two large clay jars, stoppered at the west end, and two dozen casks of wine 
stacked against the north wall. In the center of the room is a huge bin full of
fresh grapes.
