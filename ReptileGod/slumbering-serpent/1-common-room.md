# 1. Common Room

if it is daytme, the shutters are flung wide and sunlight streams into the
room from a number of large windows.
At night three fireplaces give the room a cheerful atmosphere.

During business hours, 2-8 customers will be here, enjoying a drink
or five at the large table in the center of the room (25% chance one will
be a spy for the cult from one of the outlying farms, however)

Conversations here are cheerful, and occasionally rowdy or ribald, but Belba
will not tolerate outright vulgarity.  If wine is ordered by a newcomer,
Ollwin wil break out his homemade special and the first glass will be on
the house.  It is of exceptional quality and there is an 80% chance that
each character will find it to be best they've tasted

Ollwin is the only Orlane resident who knows much about Ramne the hermit, since
he occasionally comes in to the inn to purchase supplies.  KNows that he
is someting more than he seems, and senses that the oldtimer is of good
alignment. If a party expresses a desire to get to the bottom of the town's
mystery, Ollwin will suggest that they see Ramne
