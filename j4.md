Next notes

* Would be nice to be able to hide the @^#$ and the title - I don't need
  those logging on desktop, and it consumes screen real-estate which
  is at a premium (between character sheets, Zoom windows, my source notes,
  campaign logger...)

* Should we be able to @ with just numbers?  Like if we have a player with
  a robot named 42?

* What is the green bar graph in the Campaings menubar?

* I find the tags to be much less useful than in original campaign logger
  - The saturated orange color interacts badly with my glasses (chromatic
  aberation) making it really fatiguing to read - an accessibility issue.
  - The numbers are black on a white background - so they're higher contrast
  than white on an orange background, so my eye is drawn to those rather
  than the words. So scanning through things, It's "5 1 15, oh wait @blah
  @blah 10, 15, 30", I have to work harder to not read the numbers.
  - Also, it's a mass of random-sized blocks, making it hard to find
  what I want - I have to scan through a lot of stuff, where with the old style
  broken down by letter. Essentilly now it's a one-dimensional list, like
  words on a page. But words on a page are hard to randomly access - you have
  to scan through them linerarly.  If you scan through them veritically,
  you constantly have to figure out "ok, I see a @k, and I'm looking for
  @orangeDude, that's not it, next line is still @k, next line is @m. Ok
  I can skip a couple of lines. Oops there's @p, I went too far".  It is
  far easier for me to scan down "A, B, page a bit, there it is"
  
* Along those lines, I'd love to be able to change the orange

----------

* It'd be nice to be able ot upload the campaign image.
* It'd be nice to be able to use markdown in the campaign description
* Renaming / downloading / deleting hae a lot of prominance in the UI.
  Personally I'd hide those maybe under a `V` dropdown or something.
* the animation time for the siding-out-from-the-side views is kind of
  slow.  I find myself getting a flash of frustration as I wait for it to
  open.
X It'd be nice if completion preserved case
X It'd be nice if we could shrink the text window to be smaller.  If
  you're primarily logging one or two liners, that's 8 unused lines.
* "Create/Manage Gener..." is cut off.
* On the generator, when clicking a reload button, the button has a
  focus rectangle.  I don't thnk it should stick arond unless the user
  has traversal accessibility set up.
* Same with the Generator ouroboros arrows. I click to reload, an the
  button has a highlight rectangle.  Not sure what I'm supposed to do
  with it now.  Like if I click the share button, it doesn't have
  the keyboard traversal outline.
