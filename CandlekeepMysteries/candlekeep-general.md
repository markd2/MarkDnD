## Orders of Accordance

All who enter Candlekeep must agree to the Orders of Accordance.

Violating one or more of these orders results in banishment from Candlekeep:

* No fighting!  All arguments must follow the rules of cordial debate and discussion. Violent altercations are not tolerated
* No stealing!  This rule applies to all objects in the keep, not just to the Library's works
* No copying!  Visitors are permitted to take notes while studying the library's works, but anyone who wants to make a full copy of a work must pay to have the manuscript created by scribes at the House Of The Binder
* No damaging, marking, or otherwise modifying the works!
