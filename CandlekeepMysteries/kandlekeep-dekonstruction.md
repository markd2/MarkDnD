# Kandlekeep Dekonstruction

Head-feint with the _Canopic Being_ set-up. As they start doing that, they
get the dude with Kandlekeep Dekonstruction

### Canopic Lead-in

- Mayastan Sadaar - missing "finest sages"
- Great Reader A'lai Aivenmore

### LAST EPISODE

* Jessica drinking with Orin the guide
* Jorje the barkeep

### Kandlekeep

- DeathBringer is "Dog Nuts", angry that didn't become one of the Avowed.
  "Myrkul the lord of bones let me down", one of the tied-down


### FLOW

* Vignettes prior to launch
  - See a bunch of skinny folks in robes with skulls, carrying bags of harpy
    poop out of some ruins, walking through the woods, selling to a dwarf with
    a big white chef's hat
  - Golden dragonborn, walking out of town with Bargain and Mui
  - Castle-Lantern, magical explosion at Gwatney's, breaking windows in town
    square, knocking out Moose's club
  - Some time later, repair and grand opening of _Moose and Squirrel_
  - Sam and Boz'Lee running the Dealian Tomb auditon for a new batch of recruits
  - Wedding in town square, Figboot presiding, Boz'Lee as assistant
    - celebratory parade led by a bugbear riding a t-rex through town
  - Mud season, but now into dry and dusty season
  - over-the shoulder, Figboot on a live vision-stone call with someone in a library,
    they're agitated.  They've got a weird book on their desk encased in crystal.
    pan around to figboot's face.  Usually he's pretty stoic, but you've seen him happy
    at a successful mission, or mad when someone beats him to whatever prize is 
    being sought. But never frightened. You can see fear here.
  - Figboot taking to Jessica.  Then with Klar.
    Then folks you've seen survive the audition. Then with Sam.  And Bonk.  Even
    see him take a couple of days to visit Orlane, two half orcs sisters with amazing
    cheekbones.  You remember the conversations.  They were a little weird, asking
    kind of random questions.  But not out of the ordianry when you know Figboot
    is staffing a gig that requires special skills or ... discretion.

    10 seconds... 15.... And then it stops."

    geography

* Bookwyrm (First Reader)
  - having a drink at the Hearth when earthquake hit
  - will listen to the characters about investigating the Barn Door, if convinced
    escorts them through the emerald door and gives them directions
