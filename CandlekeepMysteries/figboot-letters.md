# Figboot Letters

### Jessica

Boz'Lee, Figboot's goblin assistant gives you an envelope with some sheets
of paper.  The top-most is a handwritten letter in beautiful script:

Jessica,

Thank you so much for taking on this special mission.  Candlekeep is in
a state of concern over the disappearance of one of their finest sages Mayastan
Sadaar.  Check with Great Reader A'lai Aivenmore - she was the last
to see Mayastan and is most concerned about an unusual book Mayasta was
studying.

Punita will transport you and your team via summoning circle directly
to the Candlekeep courtyard.  Be aware that every one in the party
will need to present a unique book, pamphlet, or other form of writing
for entry.  I'll leave it to you to acquire something appropriate

You've got reservations for seven days at The Hearth.

--Figboot

P.S. Thank you for the turnip-infused liquer from Moose's private stash.
It's pretty incredible.

attachments: Candlekeep Orders of Accordance, and our latest understanding of the
Candlekeep hierarchy (The Avowed)

---
## Candlekeep orders of Accordance

(printed on Candlekeep letterhead.  Looks like a third or fourth generation
reprinting - kind of fuzzy, but still readable)

All who enter Candlekeep must agree to the Orders of Accordance.

Violating one or more of these orders results in banishment from Candlekeep:

* No fighting!  All arguments must follow the rules of cordial debate and discussion. Violent altercations are not tolerated
* No stealing!  This rule applies to all objects in the keep, not just to the Library's works
* No copying!  Visitors are permitted to take notes while studying the library's works, but anyone who wants to make a full copy of a work must pay to have the manuscript created by scribes at the House Of The Binder
* No damaging, marking, or otherwise modifying the works!

## The Avowed

The final page has notes in Figboot's handwriting.  You can recognize Boz'Lee's 
scrawl

The Avowed are Candlekeep's management hierarchy (last count was 300+) that
protects the wisdom and information held in the Great Library (and drink all the wine!)

The hierarchy is headed by The Keeper of Tomes - Archmage Janussi / human / she-her
  (top dog!)

First Reader 0 Bookwyrm / Skoda Valanster / Dragonbord / she-her

8 Readers appointed by Keeper of Tomes (in charge of their specialties)
  - Alkrist / Dragonborn / she-her / politics, military strategy, significant battles
  - A'lai Aivenmore / human / she-her, divinity, the gods and nature of the divine (big circle around this one)
  - Daral Yashenti / human / he-him, music, poetry, lieratore
  - Fheminor Scrivenbark / halfling / she-her, history, folklore, and cultures of Toril
  - Kazryn Nyantani / human / he-him - speciailzing in the natural world and celestial navigation
  - Sylvira Savikas / tiefling / he-him - the Great Wheel of the planes (big wheel keep on'turnin')
  - Teles Ahvoste / human / she-her - magic items, curses, and the Weave
  - V'ziir-Ag / gith / ??? - all things unnatural, aberrations, undead, and the Far Realm (this one is weeeeird - sketch of a frowny face)

* Master Readers - oversee the scribes and teach the adjutants

* Scribes - maintain the archives of Candlekeep

* Adjutants and Acolytes - the Bulk of the Avowed

(in scrawl) there's also a bunch of folks below the Avowed that do a lot of the real
work. They can be cranky.

### Sam

_You receives a visionstone.  When activated, you see Figboot._

Sam,

Thank you for taking on this special mission.  The higher-ups in Candlekeep are worried about the disappearance of Mayastan Sadaar, one of their great sages.  Great Reader A'lai Aivenmore should have more information - she was the last to see Mayastan.

Punita will be transporting you, Jessica, and Bonk via summoning circle directly to the Candlekeep courtyard.  To enter, you'll need to present a unique book or something written for entry.  I'll let you acquire something appropriate.

I hope you enjoy your stay at Candlekeep - you have a seven day reservation at The Hearth.

Boz'Lee is going to add some information for you that you should know about with Candlekeep's rules and our latest understaning of the Candlekeep hierarchy.

Thanks again, Sam.  Figboot out.


_Then you see the familiar goblin face of Figboot's assistant, Boz'Lee appear,  he appears to be reading off pieces of paper, occasionally taking a drag of a cigarette._

Hey Sam,

The rules of Candlekeep are pretty simple.  No fighting, no stealing anything,
including books, no copying of portions of books - but you can pay to get full
copies. What a rip-off.  And don't damage/mark/scribble-on or otherwise modify the books. 

Just between you and me, that kind of takes all the fun out of it _(giggles)_. Maybe
take an ink brush and write "bonk was here" inside of one of their books.

Aaaand _(takes a drag while shuffling paper)_ Their hierarhcy is called The Avowed.  Keeper of Tomes at the top, 8 Readers that specialize in stuff.  That Avernmore lady that Figgy talked about is one of them.  Then you got some MasterReaders _(giggles)_ that lord over the scribes and acolytes and adju...adju.. _(curses)_ ad-ju-tants, whatever the hell they are.  There's also a bunch of common folk that do the real work.

Good luck man, I think you're gonna need it.  Look after Bonk.  Don't let his brain burn out. We need him to take care of Chompy.  I _(curses)_ hate shoveling the pen when Bonk is out on a gig.


### Bonk

_You receives a visionstone.  When activated, you see Figboot._

Hi Bonk how are you?

You Sam and Jessica will be going to a library to look for a missing teacher.  Punita will send you with magic.  You will need a book to give to the library to get in.  Boz'Lee will give you some of the rules of the place.  Thank you so much for doing this mission.

_Then you see the familiar goblin face of Figboot's assistant, Boz'Lee appear,  He appears to be reading off pieces of paper, occasionally taking a drag of a cigarette._

Hey Boss, you're going to can-dle-keep.  Stupid name.  They don't really keep candles there, just a bunch of books. They got some rules.  Don't fight.  Don't steal anything.  Don't break anything.  They're no fun.

_(takes a drag, shuffles some papers, scans down them)_  That's pretty much it. Sam and whats-her-name _(laughs)_ have the deets on the people there. 

_(looks up from the paper and straight into the stone)_ Take care of yourself man.
Look after Sam.  I'll take care of Chompy while you're out, just come back soon.
_(laughs)_
