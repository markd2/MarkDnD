    an item that you lob into a group of enemies, don''t have the trigger mechanism
    down, don''t have the packing materials quite right.

    Zah - Roh - at or near the monastery (pick a place!)  Perusing the stacks? asleep
    in the room?


    How closed in the monastery - walls / gates / patrol?  There is a wall, some natural,
    some built out wall, surrounding escarpment to patrol.


    doesn''t need to be done with regularity - out on patrol on the ramparts


    (who we see) - holding a spear, plodding along, heavyset doing the rounds.  From
    one end to another, then staring out at the middle distance, and back in the other
    direction.


    Cue colors - white and black.  Garb? Not crazy, not expecting much to happen.  Average
    tunic probably


    You have early morning shift, easily recruited - volunteer/told, happy to take
    it, been patrolling along the pathways for quite a while.

    you have the western side for the morning - not looking into the sun constantly,
    not like the opposing patrol member.


    Patrols are a regular thing, taken seriously. Not expecting trouble every day.
    But the M has learned that when focus is lost, it can become dangerous


    Watch is ending soon.  When ending watch, there would be a meeting afterwards.
    Meet with one of the Vanna'

    Chandra to Roh, "glad to put a name to a face".  So hasn''t been to visit the
    DahGahTun yet.


    Right to the point, for the assignment.  Understand all that we value - serious
    oath we''ve taken to protect the monastery and protect our glorious planet. We
    must train. we must train effectively, and be ready - not know when, but there
    will be trouble that seeks to find and use the power that we protect.  Must study
    long before gain these secrets.  Time for each to advance in your understanding
    and advance in your level, and your protection you bring to the monastery.


    Would like to form the four of you into a small team that will be tasked with
    assignments in the upcoming weeks as the need advises. Task to handle challenges
    we expect to arrive. also  gain the knowledge and experience to protect us. Specifically
    for your unique capabilities.  This is not buddy buddy friendly funfun time.  Also
    not blow up your buddybuddy time.  Look out for each other regardless of disposition
    or care - a chance to demonstrate serving the greater purpose, protecting our
    way of life and world.


    Experience with Chandra - ingenuity, also time when strength and power must be
    upfront and direct - Roh, need you to punch things and hit them hard.  (grunt
    assent).


    Finally, unfortunately run into a little bit of obstacle, we''ve included another
    skilled in the arcane arts.  (Cash comes in).  footsteps - where is it, first
    day of class. trying different doors "oh god sorry!", something crashing. Burst
    into the room and trips, and scatters his scrolls, slides over the floor.  "ughghnngng".  Jumps
    up and apologies profusely.  "got lost.. sleep spell too far.. won''t happen again".

    \ \n\nThe information I've received - reading from a scroll.  \"seems that we
    are headed to the town Barbos-agha a farming town near a cost on a large\nflat
    island.  We are still gathering information, from our understanding, a little
    bit strange - traditions and people. Seem to be very fond of their local brew
    (so don't insult it). People have stopped tending the fields. Focusing their energy
    mining the caverns below them.  Crops left to rot.  Small town - something weird,
    woo - that's just people for you.\n\nBut, we found something, and asking around,
    as of a few months back, rumors emerging, unsettling - sent a few scouts, and
    only one came back. Has been despondent - little memory of what saw/went.  A few
    details.  (not promising)\n- mass hallucinations\n- human(oid) sacrifices\n- name
    \"Zandrath\" \nDoes appear to be a problem - where we come, there is a strange
    mist around town and the lands. Landscape has been been warped and twisted. Creatures
    mutated beyond recognition.  Need to navigate the fungal wilds to reach BarbosGah.\n\nwant
    us to figure out - what in the hell is going on in the town. Need to take care
    of it. That's the job ahead of us.  recommend we stick together due to how our
    scouts appeared to fare. That's all I know\"\n\nThe island is elf/human.  Sentient
    humanoid bipedal.  Not used to pandarans around. Given that confusion is a common
    theme\n"

    OK All RIght - we decided this town would be a great place for us to build a team
    to honestly use all the town people - great place to get people to do what we
    said, and we and kind of taken over. One of my idiot sisters accidentally killed
    the mayor, she''s upstairs in the room. She''s very gone.  Mistake was made. Thought
    what was going to go differently. I respect your power.


    (what''s with the goopy thing?)

    Reven leading a cult - he''s too ambitious and kill that thing, it''s kind of
    gross.


    Everyone in here is obsessed with something far below ground, and not going to
    end well. And we hoped to kind of used the town to help us out - get more power,
    making potions. Everyone is living their best lives, fuzzy brained.  Other than
    the oracle, gives them visions.  Do a drink ritual thing.


    (what are they digging down there for?)

    They believe there is a Xandrath the Enlightened they all talk about. The body
    fell into the cavern and the mind ascended. Honestly I think all the mushrooms
    is newer, and we think the source is down there, sort of a tainting of the land
    spilling out from below. Thinking there''s something down there guarding. HAven''t
    had anyone come back alive that''s ventured too far in the caverns'

    layers of white sheaths under rotting mulch. Earthy smelling.   "It''s weird,

    good spells, man
