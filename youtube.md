# Favorite YouTubers n'at


### Immediate watches

YouTube has stopped email notifications (bastards), but I still troll the notification bell.
If anything from these channels show up, I usually watch it right then.  I typically support
them on Patreon as well

* Matt Colville : https://www.youtube.com/user/mcolville . Running the game, MCDM, movie reviews.
  Dude is of My Generation so I get most of the references.  Articulate videos on dungeon
  mastering.  MCDM - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYUOOjT0j8__NMYHijAvNzg the _Chain of
  Acheron_ is/was a live-play so you can see Matt's DMing style, and a game played by nerds
  and not entertainers, but still good production values

* Skyler the Dungeonologist / ADHDnD : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1WJa6SiN5wpJm4XsXy0UNQ
  A new / low-subscriber channel.

* Matt Koebel Office Hours : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpHN-sm__o0&list=PLAmPx8nWedFVGdrP2JmcYzdvZC8sWV5b4
  Unfortunately he _really_ screwed up last April and got internet-cancelled, but he is/was an excellent
  DM (his Roll20 games are some of my favorites), and this office hours show has a lot of excellent advice
  both general and specific on RPG and at-the-table relationships.  Plus he covers a ton of
  RPG systems (Mosueguard, Burning Wheel, Powered by the Apocolypse, creator of Dungeon World,
  and on and on), so it's not just D&D.

* Guy Sclanders _How to be a Great GM_ : https://www.youtube.com/user/Bon3zmann . A lot of 
  storytelling and building advice.  He did one of my favorite live-plays 
  (Save or Dice: [haros Stones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q02LrG0Cpq8&list=PLxKZIGQZ0G2Y5aBzLq2a_PzSY7Km4DYA1) , which has some brilliant NPCs (like the talking donkey with a Sean Connery voice). Somewhere
  on his chanel are his prep streams for each session, and cool to watch the plan vs the what
  actually ahppened.

* Seth Skorkowsky : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQs8-UJ7IHsrzhQ-OQOYBmg . Module reviews
  (Call of Cthulhu and Traveller) and RPG advice and story time. A really engaging presenter,
  and his skit characters (Jack the NPC, Dweebles, etc) are surprisingly not cringy. 


* The Dungeon Run : Live on Caffeine (http://caffeine.tv/thedungeonrun) - archive  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIAatNWLMM&list=PLkgwwAiuZ301FVTHCyuuqAU39jIeAD8g_ . Highly produced live play.  Jeff Canatta is
  pretty amazing at building the story and bringing the NPCs to life.  The characters have a
  great chemistry.  Most fun catching it live 9pm eastern on wednesdays to enjoy the chat
  and "props" giving (3-D animated fidget toys).  Plus there's a puppet mindflayer who is the
  host.

* Web DM : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7XFmdssWgaPzGyGbKk8GaQ - pun nerd interviews
  DM expert.  The intros and outtakes are usually really clever.  They're long, so I sometimes
  ADHD out in the middle.

* DungeonCraft : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD6ERRdXrF2IZ0R888G8PQg - with Professor
  Dungeonmaster.  Old school DM, with crafting, painting, encoutner design, and game-play
  advice.  He has a very active Patreon with a lot of behind-the-scenes and extended cuts.


### Occasional Watches

* https://www.youtube.com/user/Nerdarchy - Nerdarchy. They pump out a lot of content. Some of
  which is brilliant, some is filler.  Nerdarchist Dave has resurrected a daily one-hour
  interview, and he's a surprisingly good interviewer.  One of the more amazing ones was
  with Jen Kretchmer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5E2A9Na-c84 , with an extended discussion
  on accessibility at cons.

* XP To Level 3 : https://www.youtube.com/user/TheDrModnar - hyperbole-oriented player and
  DM advice.  His G-Fuel "fireball" are some of the best bad youtube ads.

* Runesmith : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCweFJojRAFuxyYxe4KHL8vw - surreal advice videos
  with a pleasant voice.

* Captcorajus : https://www.youtube.com/user/captcorajus - RPG retro reviews.  He reviews 
  a bunch of the stuff I grew up on (old modules, GammaWorld, etc). Plus has one of the best
  intro songs (epic... reggae?)

* RuneHamer : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCh5vto8JFstb9Sma9zV25g - Drunkards and Dragons /
  "Hankerin Ferinale" - the developer of "Index Card RPG", and has a lot of older how-to
  videos, minis, etc.  His live design / drawing streams are really cool.

* Taking20 : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCly0Thn_yZouwdJtg7Am62A - DM and player advice,
  top-10 lists.  He's going through some family health issues and hasn't been posting lately.
  Cody's one of those you either really enjoy, or find completely insufferable.


### Watched some, then bounced off of

But you might like them.

* The Dungeon Coach : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz8xkTADYdRQR7GP-f2PjOA - has good advice
  but the sports / coach style got tiring quickly.

* Sly Flourish - the Lazy Dungeon Master : https://www.youtube.com/user/SlyFlourish1 - his LazyDM
  book is really good.  His channel is mainly session prep using his lazy method. After the
  first couple I watched, they got to be pretty much the same.

* Questing Beast - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvYwePdbWSEwUa-Pk02u3Zw - OSR (Old School
  Renaissance / Rules) specialist.  Not a fan of the "flip through a book and talk about
  random stuff" style of reviews.
