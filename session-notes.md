# Session 3 - Dinner is Served



<img align="right" src="./assets/gwatney-token.png" />

The party enters the tavern, greeted by a Dwarf standing by the kitchen door - "Welcome to Gwatney's!  
Have a drink!  Dinner coming up soon!", seeing some tables pushed together, seating about 8.

<img align="left" src="./assets/elf-token.png" />
Behind the bar, a tall thin (young) Elf, very well dressed.  Nervous.

Bargain orders an Aqua Fresca something.  Tilson turns sheet white, visibly frightened.
"We don't mention... _her_ around here" (glances towards kitchen), can I get you anything?

Mui: "ChocolateMilk" Sam: "Gin and Tonic" simultaneously,

Tilson makes a combination of chocolate (sour) milk with gin and tonic and gives it to 
Bargain and Sam.  Jessica has straight gin.  Mui has water.  
Laeryn has a pumpkin spice latte.  Tilson boils the coffee water with his hands.

<img align="left" src="./assets/yansha-token.png" />
Yansha (Orlova), town guard, comes in, gets an ale, thanks the party, and engages in some
small-talk.  Bargain relates the story of his village being overrun by Bugbears Mounted
on Giant Spiders.

<img align="right" src="./assets/koebel-token.png" />
Before dinner arrived, Daniel Owensmane, a human in priestly purple vestments, fastidious. Pink
hair.  Glasses.  Unblinking stare.  He's a priest of Merrika, the patron goddess of harvest and
luck. (The temple in Orlane is the same denomination).  "I heard something strange happened 
in Orlane.  We haven't really heard from them for six months."  (Yansha looks askance.  "You
were receiving visitors from them every other week or so"  "oh. I guess you're.. right"). 
He reminds you of the post-Repitle-God confusion you saw in Orlane.
Sam surreptitiously casts Lessor Restoration which unscrambles his brain a little bit.  He
tended to stare at the kitchen door.

Laeryn feels a bit of weirdness. Just a brief bit of discomfort that fades.

Tilson goes to the back and brings out the salad course - greens, with short noodles. Basalmic
dressing.  It's fantastic.  Bargain loses his lunch in front of the kitchen.

<img align="left" src="./assets/borq-token.png" />
Tall Tabaxi, glorious black fur, walks in, carrying a lot of gear.  Tilson goes
"Hey Moose, thanks for coming by on short notice" and tosses him a small bag of coins.
Moose takes a seat on the stage, unpacks a lute, violin, and some bagpipes, and starts playing
some really nice background music.  Pretty amazing doing multiple-voice counterpart on a lute.

Laeryn again feels a bit of weirdness.  Stronger than last time. Sam feels it too.  Kind of 
a "someone walking over your grave" feeling.  Party freaks out, and starts leaving.  Moose,
hurt that folks are walking out, asks "what's wrong"  "something weird is going on!"  "oh! That's
just how Gwatney makes dinner.  You get used to it."

Tilson comes out with the soup course - creamy lobster bisque style, with chunks of
gnocchi.  Amazing.

Somewhere along the line, Bargain runs towards the kitchen door, and is rebuffed... by a door
(it doesn't move at all). And loses his lunch.  Tilson cleans it up the mess magically.

Somewhere along the line, Sam detects magic.  Sees the spellcasters with their usual
faint glow of magic-capacity, including Tilson the bartender and waiter.  Moose has a similar
glow. His instruments glow noticeably, so he's definitely getting some magical amplification
for the background music (enchantment).  The bar glows noticeably (transmutation).
The kitchen door glows _so_ brightly and intensely that Sam couldn't tell the school.

Somewhere along the line, when Tilson is in the kitchen, Jessica raids
the bar, discovering it's basically a TARDIS of alcohol. Jessica
acquires some turnip spirits, in a decorative commemorative
turnip-shaped bottle.

Yansha is loosening up - talking about some ruins found outside of town a week or two ago. 
Some teens were out
exploring out in the forest (Castle-Lantern, and Nextia especially are frontier towns) and found
them.  No one has returned yet - the forest is thick, and the terrain difficult.

<img align="right" src="./assets/mayor-token.png" />
Wilson Failbood, the Castle-Lantern mayor walks right before the main course.  He thanks
the party as well, passively-aggressively needling Yansha and the town guard. Jessica calls
him out on it.

Discussion returns to the ruins.  "You figured out how to drive that giant drill, right?" 
(yes! Yes, we're total experts!)  "Maybe you can take some of us out there".
Wilson doesn't really believe the ruins are interesting or relevant.  Yansha counters with
"That damn undead-disgorging machine. It's point right. at. the. ruins. They've got to be
connected"  The party sides with Yansha because Wilson is a total tool.

Before the main course, the entire party feels a really strong burst
of magic, coming from the kitchen, as Tilson brings out the main
course - grilled meat, some veggies, and a birds-nest of spaghetti
(perfectly made).  Jessica consumes turnip spirits and vectors her
food onto Sam's and Bargain's plates.

Mayor Wilson excuses himself.  Sam privately relates an amusing anecdote (so it seems)
but is actually giving him a dressing down about treating his subordinates better.

As Tilson is cleaning up the table, Gwatney comes out, carrying a sack of something.
"So, how did you like your dinner.  We appreciate all you have done for us this day.
And now, dessert".

Gwatney places a turnip on everyone's plate. Moose changes instruments. Gwatney starts
casting some _intense_ magic, disassociating the turnips, and over the course of a minute or two
reforms it into a baked-alaska style ice cream dessert, with sweet macaroni forming a
scalloped edge. It's also amazing.  "Everything tonight has been made from turnip.  That's
about all we can reliably get out here" (shrugging).  "It has been a tiring night, enjoy
your dessert, and please come back soon!"  And he exits through the kitchen door.

Tilson makes last call.  Daniel leaves, returning to the temple. "that's ok, I don't need
an escort back.  I grew up there - my mother was the priest. It's home".  Jessica asks
for another bottle of turnip-derivative.  He smiles, goes in to the bar, opens a cabinet 
deep within in.  "Hey, I'm stuck, can you pull me out?"  Looking over the bar, you can only see
his feet sticking out from the shelves.  Jessica pulls him out.  Tilson dusts off the
bottle of turnip liqueur, labeled with just a stylized turnip.  "I think you may enjoy
this even more than the other stuff"

Moose wraps up his set.  "If you liked what you heard, remember me, Pamelmousse LaCroix!",
and starts packing up his gear.  He squeezes Yansha's hand on the way out.
Yansha invites the party to stay in the CastleLatern Inn.  The former innkeeper was killed
by the Boring Machine, but Moose runs the front desk.

Heading over, the party gets keys to their rooms.  Mui and Bargain do Monk Things in the
beergarden (currently piles of tables and crates).  Moose joins in by throwing magic
daggers at them Matrix-Bullet-Time-Style.  Impressive performances by Mui and Bargain.

Long rest. Everyone recharges. Breakfast the next morning. Jessica acquires the majority of
the bacon, and talks Moose out of a giant sandwich for the road.  The party discovers that
Moose was planning on eventually buying the Inn and turning it into a night club. "I can
perform here.  My friends can perform here".  He's really appreciative of the very generous
tips from folks checking out.

Montage swinging by the Guard House. Yansha giving instructions to a lieutenant.  "and don't 
forget to pay this this and this by mid-week, oh! and make sure the cells are turned over
before the weekend."  She's almost giddy hearing how generous the party was towards
Moose.  "That'll get us so much closer", and then grabs her pack and bustles out towards the
Borer.

# Session 2 - Fun in Town

Inside of the Borer in the Castle-Lantern graveyard, 
Jessica and Bargain are at the dashboard figuring
things out.  From the inside, you can see out of a window over
the boring blade.  On the "driver's side" of the forward control
panel, the primary controls are a lever in a horizontal track with
five positions, currently in the middle.  and another lever in a vertical
track with three positions. Currently in the middle.  The machine
gently thrums.

With Jessica moving the vertical lever up, the thrum becomes
rapid.  Moving the lever back to the middle returns the thrum
to its original tempo.  Moving the lever down cuts power and
turns on a dim red light inside.  Bargain figures out how to
turn on and off the inner lights.

The inside of the borer is empty space, with two dozen subway handles
hanging from the ceiling. The wall opposite the door has panels and 
buttons similar to the map-device on the front dashboard.  Towards
the back is a large glowing stone, brightening and dimming in rhythm
to the machine's thrumming.

Mui is experimenting with the door.  A pushbutton
(glowing) drops the door open (anyone outside, LOOK OUT! as the door
slams down), and pushing again draws it up.  There's also a lever
in a vertical track next to the door (three positions, middle position)
with what feels like a mechanical linkage around the door, acting like
an emergency door opener.

Sam went out to chat with Yanhsa (captain of the guard) about
(I forget why, outside of a search for alcohol for Jessica), when
she invites the crew to dinner and a night at the town Inn in
appreciation. "oh, and there's something weird going on at the library
if you have some time"

Sam returned (no alcohol), to fill everyone in, and started examining
the glowing stone - it's in a glass cylinder (about two
feet in diameter), held in place with a coupling collar. When Jessica 
turns off the power to the device, the stone goes dark and Sam removes
it.  It's like a red gem(?) Jessica couldn't turn the machine back 
on again.  Sam restores the gem.  Everything returns to normal.

After more poking around the device, found the keyfob in the dashboard
and figured out how to lock and unlock the device.

### The Paper Chase

A young, blonde Elf wearing gray robes, came running into the area. He
was shouting "Arma's hurt!  Yansha!  Yansha!  You have to come help!"
Yansha took off running, with the party hot oh her heels.  Running through
town, it's a much larger place than Nextia, probably the same population
as Orlane, but much more densely packed (and without glowing numerals
rotating above each of the buildings).  

The Elf (Darrel Southwell, the library assistant) and Yansha stop in front
of the library.  "I was downstairs trying to repair the damage.  Arma
heard something upstairs.  I heard a shout and a scream, and then silence.
Go get Yansha. That was my first thought"

Entering, you see a scene of bookish destruction. Tall 
bookshelves, with most of their contents on the floor.  Investigating the
shelves, Jessica discovers neat piles of pages at the end of each row of
bookshelves.  They're complete stories.  Laeryn reads a book of Elven 
stories, or at least tries to.  Numerous spans of pages are torn(?) out.
The book of stories has nothing in it but the commentaries between the
stories.

There's a sound from upstairs.  Some kind of shuffling.  Bargain stealths
away and heads upstairs, with Mui not far behind.  Up the stairs is a similar
scene of horror - books off one of the shelves, a nice stack of removed pages
at the end of the bookshelf. And going through the books is a... dinosaur?
made of ... paper?

![](ThirdAdventure/handouts/thesaurus.png)

It's methodically grabbing a book from the shelf.  Flipping through the
pages, and with a paper claw, slicing out some pages, and adding it to
the stack.  Mui sees Arma (Wynn), a red-skin Tiefling, in a gray
robe. She's slumped on the floor. Maybe some blood there.

The rest of the party joins the monks, narrowly avoiding the squeaking stair
tread.  Jessica runs past the monster to grab Arma behind some bookshelves,
determines she's alive, and tries to stabilize her. Sam assists.  

Mui and Bargain engage with the Thesaurus. Blows are exchanged
(bludgeoning seems to not really... do much), the tide of battle not
really turning until Jessica cuts it with her sword, un-handing it.  
Mui absorbs the bulk of damage the monster dealt from its bite(?) 
and claws(?), sustaining wicked paper cuts.  Laeryn lands the killing blow,
and the Thesaurus crumples into a green and white paper boulder.  Mui
recovers a sizable quantity of paper _(I forgot the actual dimensions, 
hope you did :-) )_

Sam heals up most of the party, leaving Jessica alone per request.
Sam also get Arma up and talking.  "We're just a small town library
with a really great collection, left to us when a wealthy land owner
died 50 years ago.  Scholars from around the area come by for research.
Figboot's friend Punita was here a couple of days ag. We had a wonderful
time talking about everything, and I took off yesterday and gave
Darrell some time off because we were exhausted. Puntia ran us ragged.
When I got here this morning, there was this scene of destruction, and
you kind of know the rest."

Darrell lopes up the stairs and takes over taking care of Arma, as the
party leaves the Library. Yansha led the party across the town square,
to Gwatney's cafe for food and drink. Upon entering the beautiful 
eatery, the party is greeted by a red-haired dwarf (graying) coming
out of the kitch, chef's outfit (kind of like what Klär wore on occasion
on her vision-stone program) and apron, pristinely clean. "Welcome to Gwatney's!"

----

# Session 1 - A Boring Day

Bargain (halfling monk) and Quon (gold dragonborn monk) coming into
Nextia, a small bump in the road along the road who's main economies
are farming, livestock, and adventurers. Nextia has Azizah's smithy,
Grindlebrew's house of potions, Punita's _Publisher's Bookshop_, and
_Figboot's Inn and Tavern_.

Coming in to town, they met Sam talking (?) with Lord
Peter Chompsey.  From our point of view, it sounds like a lot of
screaming.  A sturdy bugbear was mucking out Chompy's pen, complaining
about dinosaur poop.  Quon ducked in to Figboot's, leaving Bargain to
watch.

Bargain felt a buzzing on his finger.  Anyone who works with Figboot
is given a ring - if you want to earn some gold doing a job for Figboot,
put on the ring. When there's work, it'll ~page~ mystically vibrate
for the wearer.  Take it off when you're not available.

Heading in to Figboot's, he sees Azizah Ironhammer bolting out of the
door, screaming "They've Kidnapped Xander!  You have to come help me", and
a party of four or five adventurers running after here. The one in
bright shiny armor shouting "Take comfort!  We will save him!".  

Going to
the door, Bargain sees Boz'Lee - Figboot's goblin assistant, leaning against
the building smoking a cigarette.  Boz'Lee says "yah, another audition.  I
gotta keep a low profile til they're out."  Glances at his bare wrist.  "Still
got a couple of hours before I gotta go help. Figgy's got a new job. Come'on"

The tavern is a typical tavern, six or so tables.  The local farmers sometimes
grab lunch or meals here.  On the wall is a framed object - an offset longsword
with a signed note "Mel, you make the best R.W.A.F. in the land.  <3 Klär"

Boz'Lee heads to the kitchen to get some snacks. Sam buys Bargain
a R.W.A.F.™.  Then the crew assembles in Figboot's office, a familiar place
when getting assignments.  While waiting for Figboot, Quon comes out, looking
kind of disturbed, and tells Bargain that he's got to go take care of something
and he's on his own.

The assignment is something weird happening in Castle-Lantern.  Not sure what.
Standard pay. The pay schedule

* General task - 100gp each
* Task with risk to life and limb - 250gp each
* Risky task. Don't ask questions. Just do it. - 500gp each

10gp advance before leaving.  Credit line at the Stables (horse mount 2gp/day)

Ratcatchers are welcome to any treasure or magic items found during
the assignment.

Jessica spends her advance on three flasks of alcohol, and tips Floon
well.  They have an understanding.


### On the Road

The party heads north to Castle-Lantern on horseback.  On the road,
Sam hears "Make way! On your left!  Make way!".  Sam yields the left
side of the road, as a man (casually dressed) on an ostrich zooms by.
"Thank you I appreciate it...." as he dopplers path.


### In Castle-Lantern

Entering the small town of Castle-Lantern (about the same size
as Orlane, which some of the party is quite familiar with), the party
hears q commotion coming from across town. Heading that way lead by Jessica, they're intercepted
by Yansha, the Captain of the town guard. She looks to be a career guardshuman.

"We don't know what's really going on.  A giant... thing erupted out of the
cemetery on the edge of town, vomiting forth undead who started attacking
the town. We've managed to fight them back and keep them from getting
back into town, but we can't stop them.  They seem army. They know what
they're doing.  Beware of the door.  Our innkeeper went to check it out
when it appeared, and got crushed by the door when it opened.

Heading to the cemetery, the party sees a large, house-sized metal contraption
with a dimly glowing purple crystal in the back.  The device is cylindrical,
with three tank treads equidistant around its circumference. It's not moving,
and vaguely thrumming.  A squad of undead - skeletons in tattered uniforms,
with a tough looking squad leader barking out orders in an unfamiliar
tongue, and the troops doing calisthenics.

An attempt at parlay was met by battle.  Bargain and Mui deploying
brilliant team tactics.  Sam and Jessica trading taunts and
congratulations.  One squad defeated, as another squad marched around
the back side of the contraption.  The door opens.  Bargain (I think)
was almost crushed by the door, but hopped up on a tread.  The general
popped out, inspiring the troops, but she too was eventually defeated.
Upon her death, the remaining half-squad of undead soldiers perished.

All was quiet. Except an occasional thrum... thrum...

Jessica leading the way into the borer, sits down at the console and fiddles
around for a while, she managed to make it lurch forward a bit using foot
pedals.  Tweedling knobs on the console made a screen light up.  Mostly
it was glowing text, replaced by more glowing text, in an alphabet(?) that
nobody recognizes.

After some time, they found what looks like a map of the continent,
but not quite as folks remember.  _(Presuming Bargain's wide travels
gives him a knowledge of regional geography)_ An extra peninsula where
a large island should be. A couple of missing large bodies of water.  Turing
one of the knobs. A dot appears in a far corner.  Turning the knob, it grows
into a straight line. Then the straight line angles. Then angles again. Then
it stops moving. A couple of turns later, the line starts moving
again, but in an erratic fashion, like a housefly buzzing around.  This
goes on for quite the distance, until it stops.  Which happens to be around
where you are on the great map of the area.
