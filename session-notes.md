# Session 1 - A Boring Day

Bargain (halfling monk) and Quon (gold dragonborn monk) coming into
Nextia, a small bump in the road along the road who's main economies
are farming, livestock, and adventurers. Nextia has Azizah's smithy,
Grindlebrew's house of potions, Punita's _Publisher's Bookshop_, and
_Figboot's Inn and Tavern_.

Coming in to town, they met Sam talking (?) with Lord
Peter Chompsey.  From our point of view, it sounds like a lot of
screaming.  A sturdy bugbear was mucking out Chompy's pen, complaining
about dinosaur poop.  Quon ducked in to Figboot's, leaving Bargain to
watch.

Bargain felt a buzzing on his finger.  Anyone who works with Figboot
is given a ring - if you want to earn some gold doing a job for Figboot,
put on the ring. When there's work, it'll ~page~ mystically vibrate
for the wearer.  Take it off when you're not available.

Heading in to Figboot's, he sees Azizah Ironhammer bolting out of the
door, screaming "They've Kidnapped Xander!  You have to come help me", and
a party of four or five adventurers running after here. The one in
bright shiny armor shouting "Take comfort!  We will save him!".  

Going to
the door, Bargain sees Boz'Lee - Figboot's goblin assistant, leaning against
the building smoking a cigarette.  Boz'Lee says "yah, another audition.  I
gotta keep a low profile til they're out."  Glances at his bare wrist.  "Still
got a couple of hours before I gotta go help. Figgy's got a new job. Come'on"

The tavern is a typical tavern, six or so tables.  The local farmers sometimes
grab lunch or meals here.  On the wall is a framed object - an offset longsword
with a signed note "Mel, you make the best R.W.A.F. in the land.  <3 Klär"

Boz'Lee heads to the kitchen to get some snacks. Sam buys Bargain
a R.W.A.F.™.  Then the crew assembles in Figboot's office, a familiar place
when getting assignments.  While waiting for Figboot, Quon comes out, looking
kind of disturbed, and tells Bargain that he's got to go take care of something
and he's on his own.

The assignment is something weird happening in Castle-Lantern.  Not sure what.
Standard pay. The pay schedule

* General task - 100gp each
* Task with risk to life and limb - 250gp each
* Risky task. Don't ask questions. Just do it. - 500gp each

10gp advance before leaving.  Credit line at the Stables (horse mount 2gp/day)

Ratcatchers are welcome to any treasure or magic items found during
the assignment.

Jessica spends her advance on three flasks of alcohol, and tips Floon
well.  They have an understanding.


### On the Road

The party heads north to Castle-Lantern on horseback.  On the road,
Sam hears "Make way! On your left!  Make way!".  Sam yields the left
side of the road, as a man (casually dressed) on an ostrich zooms by.
"Thank you I appreciate it...." as he dopplers path.


### In Castle-Lantern

Entering the small town of Castle-Lantern (about the same size
as Orlane, which some of the party is quite familiar with), the party
hears q commotion coming from across town. Heading that way lead by Jessica, they're intercepted
by Yansha, the Captain of the town guard. She looks to be a career guardshuman.

"We don't know what's really going on.  A giant... thing erupted out of the
cemetery on the edge of town, vomiting forth undead who started attacking
the town. We've managed to fight them back and keep them from getting
back into town, but we can't stop them.  They seem army. They know what
they're doing.  Beware of the door.  Our innkeeper went to check it out
when it appeared, and got crushed by the door when it opened.

Heading to the cemetery, the party sees a large, house-sized metal contraption
with a dimly glowing purple crystal in the back.  The device is cylindrical,
with three tank treads equidistant around its circumference. It's not moving,
and vaguely thrumming.  A squad of undead - skeletons in tattered uniforms,
with a tough looking squad leader barking out orders in an unfamiliar
tongue, and the troops doing calisthenics.

An attempt at parlay was met by battle.  Bargain and Mui deploying
brilliant team tactics.  Sam and Jessica trading taunts and
congratulations.  One squad defeated, as another squad marched around
the back side of the contraption.  The door opens.  Bargain (I think)
was almost crushed by the door, but hopped up on a tread.  The general
popped out, inspiring the troops, but she too was eventually defeated.
Upon her death, the remaining half-squad of undead soldiers perished.

All was quiet. Except an occasional thrum... thrum...

Jessica leading the way into the borer, sits down at the console and fiddles
around for a while, she managed to make it lurch forward a bit using foot
pedals.  Tweedling knobs on the console made a screen light up.  Mostly
it was glowing text, replaced by more glowing text, in an alphabet(?) that
nobody recognizes.

After some time, they found what looks like a map of the continent,
but not quite as folks remember.  _(Presuming Bargain's wide travels
gives him a knowledge of regional geography)_ An extra peninsula where
a large island should be. A couple of missing large bodies of water.  Turing
one of the knobs. A dot appears in a far corner.  Turning the knob, it grows
into a straight line. Then the straight line angles. Then angles again. Then
it stops moving. A couple of turns later, the line starts moving
again, but in an erratic fashion, like a housefly buzzing around.  This
goes on for quite the distance, until it stops.  Which happens to be around
where you are on the great map of the area.

During this time, Bargain has been taking notes of the unfamiliar words(?).
Perhaps someone back in Nextia can decipher them.
